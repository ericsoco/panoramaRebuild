## HashManager

Manage and store the state of your application with the URL hash. This component provides hooks for updating the URL hash with serialized state, and fires events when the hash changes, with updated state parsed from the hash. It also provides utilities for managing map-related state (zoom and lat/lon center).

#### Usage
```js
import { HashManager } from '@panorama/toolkit';
// TODO: usage
```
