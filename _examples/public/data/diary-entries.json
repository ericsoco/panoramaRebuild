Soon after we took up our line of march, and after advancing about three miles, encamped near the banks of Big Soldier creek, for the purpose of organizing the company by an election of officers; the officers then acting having been elected to serve only until the company should reach this place. It was decided, when at Independence, that here there should be a thorough and complete organization. Great interest had been manifested in regard to the matter while upon the road; but now when we had reached the spot and the period for attending to the matter in earnest had arrived, the excitement was intense. The most important officers to be elected were the pilot and the captain of the company. There were two candidates for the office of pilot. —one, a Mr. Adams, from Independence, —the other a Mr. Meek, from the same place. Mr. Adams had once been as far west as Fort Laramie, had in his possession Gilpin's Notes5, had engaged a Spaniard, who had traveled over the whole route, to accompany him, and moreover had been conspicuously instrumental in producing the \"Oregon fever.\" In case the company would elect him pilot, and pay him five hundred dollars, in advance, he would bind himself to pilot them to Fort Vancouver. Mr. Meek, an old mountaineer, had spent several years as a trader and trapper, among the mountains, and had once been through to Fort Vancouver; he proposed to pilot us through for two hundred and fifty dollars, thirty of which were to be paid in advance, and the balance when we arrived at Fort Vancouver. A motion was then made to postpone the election to the next day. While we were considering the motion, Meek came running into the camp, and informed us that the Indians were driving away our cattle. This intelligence caused the utmost confusion: motions and propositions, candidates and their special friends, were alike desregarded; rifles were grasped, and horses were hastily mounted, and away we all galloped in pursuit. Our two thousand head of cattle were now scattered over the prairie, at a distance of four or five miles from the camp.  About two miles from Cap, in full view, up the prarie, was a small Indian village; the greater part of our enraged people, with the hope of hearing from the lost cattle, drove rapidly forward to this place. As they approached the village, the poor Indians were seen running to and fro, in great dismay— their women and children sulking about and hiding themselves, —while the chiefs came forward, greeted our party kindly, and by signs offered to smoke the pipe of peace, and engage them in trade. On being charged with the theft of our cattle, they firmly asserted their innocence; and such was their conduct, that the majority of the party was convinced they had been wrongfully accused: but one poor fellow, who had just returned to the village, and manifested great alarm upon seeing so many \"pale faces,\" was taken; and failing to prove his innocence, was hurried away to camp and placed under guard. Meanwhile, after the greater part of the company had returned to camp, and the captain had assembled the judges, the prisoner was arraigned at the bar for trial, and the solemn interrogatory, \"Are you guilty or not guilty,\" was propounded to him: but to this, his only answer was— a grunt, the import of which the honorable court not being able clearly to comprehend, his trial was formally commenced and duly carried through. The evidence brought forward against him not being sufficient to sustain the charge, he was fully acquitted; and, when released, \"split\" for his wigwam in the village. After the excitement had in some degree subsided, and the affair was calmly considered, it was believed by most of us that the false alarm in regard to the Indians had been raised with the design of breaking up or postponing the election. If such was the design, it succeeded admirably..","journal_id":128,"lat":39.098228,"location":"3 miles from Kansas River on the bank of Soldier Creek, KS","long":-95.688,"name":"Joel Palmer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-14.600014,-1.643761]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":2310,"date":"8/30/1849","entry":"30th Took an early start and went through a region of sage passed sage a shallow stream in Sage Valley kamped in a Kanyon 1/2 m from the lake.","journal_id":136,"lat":41.57982,"location":"Est DT 15mi","long":-119.768,"name":"Elijah Bryan Farnham"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[2.798883,-5.361011]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":856,"date":"5/20/1845","entry":"We have this day traveled fifteen miles, through a prairie country, with occasionally a small grove along the streams.","journal_id":128,"lat":39.561765,"location":"15 miles from location on 5/17 (exact location unknown), KS","long":-96.3681,"name":"Joel Palmer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[0.78773,-4.341695]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":865,"date":"6/3/1845","entry":"Having traveled about eight miles, we halted at noon, making short drives, to enable the rear company to join us.

Flour, sugar, coffee, tea, tobacco, powder and lead, sell readily, at high prices. In the afternoon we gave the Indians a feast, and held a long talk with them. Each family, as they could best spare it, contributed a portion of bread, meat, coffee orsugar, which being cooked, a table was set by spreading buffalo skins upon the ground, and arranging the provisions upon them. Around this attractive board, the Indian chiefs and their principal men seated themselves, occupying one fourth of the circle; the remainder of the male Indians made out the semi-circle; the rest of the circle was completed by the whites. The squaws and younger Indians formed an outer semi-circular row immediately behind their dusky lords and fathers. Two stout young warriors were now designated as waiters, and all the preparations being completed, the Indian chiefs and principal men shook hands, and at a signal the white chief performed the same ceremony, commencing with the principal chief, and saluting him and those of his followers who composed the first division of the circle; the others being considered inferiors, were not thus noticed. The talk preceded the dinner. A trader acted as interpreter. The chief informed us, that \"a long while ago some white chiefs passed up the Missouri, through his country, saying they were the red man's friends, and that as the red man found them, so would he find all the other pale faces. This country belongs to the red man, but his white brethren travels through, shooting the game and scaring it away. Thus the Indian loses all that he depends upon to support his wives and children. The children of the red man cry for food, but there is no food. But on the other hand, the Indian profits by the trade with the white man. He was glad to see us and meet us as friends, it was the custom when the pale faces passed through his country, to make presents to the Indians of powder, lead, &c. His tribe was very numerous, but the most of the people had gone to the mountains to hunt. Before the white man came, the game was tame, and easily caught, with the bow and arrow. Now the white man has frightened it, and the red man must go to the mountains. The red man needed long guns.\" This, with much more of the like, made up the talk of the chief, when a reply from our side was expected. As it devolved on me to play the part of the white chief, I told my red brethren, that we were journeying to the great waters of the west. Our great father owned a large country there, and we were going to settle upon it. For this purpose we brought with us our wives and little ones. We were compelled to pass through the red man's country, but we traveled as friends, and not as enemies. As friends we feasted them, shook them by the hand, and smoked with them the pipe of peace. They must know that we came among them as friends, for we brought with us our wives and children. The red man does not take his squaws into battle: neither does the pale face. But friendly as we felt, we were ready for enemies; and if molested, we should punish the offenders. Some of us expected to return. Our fathers, our brothers and our children were coming behind us, and we hoped the red man would treat them kindly. We did not expect to meet so many of them; we were glad to see them, and to hear that they were the white man's friends. We met peacefully— so let us part. We had set them a feast, and were glad to hold a talk.with them; but we were not traders, and had no powder or ball to give them. We were going to plough and to plant the ground, and had nothing more than we needed for ourselves. We told them to eat what was before them, and be satisfied; and that we had nothing more to say. The two Indian servants began their services by placing a tin cup before each of the guests, always waiting first upon the chiefs; they then distributed the bread and cakes, until each person had as much as it was supposed he would eat; the remainder being delivered to two squaws, who in like manner served the squaws and children. The waiters then distributed the meat and coffee. All was order. No one touched the food before him until all were served, when at a signal from the chief the eating began. Having filled themselves, the Indians retired, taking with them all that they were unable to eat. This is a branch of the Sioux nation, and those living in this region number near fifteen hundred lodges. They are a healthy, athletic, good-looking set of men, and have according to the Indian code, a respectable sense of honor, but will steal when they can do so without fear of detection. On this occasion, however, we missed nothing but a frying pan, which a squaw slipped under her blanket, and made off with. As it was a trifling loss, we made no complaint to the chief. Here are two forts. Fort Laramie, situated upon the west side of Laramie's fork, two miles from Platte river, belongs to the North American Fur Company. The fort is built of adobes. The walls are about two feet thick, and twelve or fourteen feet high, the tops being picketed or spiked. Posts are planted in these walls, and support the timber for the roof. They are covered with mud. In the centre is an open square, perhaps twenty-five yards each way, along the sides of which are ranged the dwellings, store rooms, smith shop, carpenter's shop, offices, &c., all fronting upon the inner area. There are two principal entrances; one at the north, the other at the south. On the eastern side is an additional wall, connected at its extremities with the first, enclosing ground for stables and carrell. This enclosure has a gateway upon its south side, and a passage into the square of the principal enclosure. At a short distance from the fort is a field of about four acres, in which, by way of experiment, corn is planted; but from its present appearance it will probably prove a failure. Fort John stands about a mile below Fort Laramie, and is built of the same material as the latter, but is not so extensive. Its present occupants are a company from St. Louis.","journal_id":128,"lat":42.215133,"location":"Fort Laramie, WY","long":-104.517,"name":"Joel Palmer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-14.35096,2.539098]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":971,"date":"9/27/1845","entry":"This morning we discovered that several of our trail ropes had been stolen.

The road leading down into the valley of Grand Round, is circuitous, and its difficulty of travel enhanced by its roughness; it is about one and a half miles in length, to where it reaches the bottom. Grand Round is a valley, whose average width does not exceed twenty miles, and is about thirty miles in length; a stream of water of some twenty yards in width passes through this valley, receiving considerable addition to its volume from the many rivulets that pour down their waters from the mountains, by which this valley is enclosed. The bottoms are of rich friable earth, and afford grass of various kinds, among others that of red clover. There is a root here found in great abundance, and known as the camas, which is held in high repute by the Indians for some medicinal qualities it is thought to possess; wild flax and a variety of other plants grow in luxuriance, like to those I have observed in the western prairies. The streams are generally lined with timber, and abound in salmon and other varieties of fish. Upon the sides of the mountains and extending down into the valley are found beautiful groves of yellow pine timber. These mountains are places of resort for bear, deer, and elk. This bottom affords an excellent situation for a settlement, possessing more advantages in that respect, than any found since our departure from the lower Platte River. North of this and at the distance of about twenty miles, is another valley, similar in appearance to this, but of greater extend. The streams having their course through this valley empty into Lewis River, which is eighty or ninety miles to the north. Our camp was at the foot of the hill, convenient to a spring branch. At twilight we were visited by four or five of the Caiguse, the tribe alluded to previously. An incident quite worthy of note, occurred at this place. The chief (Aliquot by name)5 who had joined us at our other encampment, and had pursued this day's journey in company, had pitched his tent some three hundred yards to the rear of our camp. In the evening, in strolling about the camp, I came near his tent, and entered with the intention of employing his squaw in the soling of my moccasins; while she was engaged in this employment, a conversation had sprung up between the old chief and myself, in which he took occasion to ask me if I were a christian, as also whether there were many upon the road; to which questions I of course answered in the affirmative, supposing that he merely wished to know, whether I classed myself with the heathen or christians. On my return to our camp, some one of our party proposed that we should while away an hour or so, in a game at cards, which was readily assented to. We had but engaged in our amusement, when the old chief Aliquot made his appearance, holding a small stick in his hand; he stood transfixed for a moment, and then advanced to me, raising his hand, which held the stick in the act of chastising me, and gently taking me by the arm, said \"Captain— Captain— no good; no good.\" You may guess my astonishment, at being thus lectured by a \"wild and untutored savage,\" twenty five hundred miles from a civilized land. I inwardly resolved to abandon card playing forever.","journal_id":128,"lat":45.234495,"location":"La Grande Ronde Valley, OR ","long":-118.013,"name":"Joel Palmer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-15.484824,-3.757846]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1523,"date":"1/7/1847","entry":"Continues fine freezeing hard at night very cold this morning wind S.S.E dont think we will have much more snow snow not thawing much not much dimeinished in debph.

We then determined to make a trip over the mountains, and made inquiries respecting its practicability of some Indians, but could learn nothing definite, excepting that grass, timber and water would be found in abundance; we finally ascertained that a Mr. Barham and Mr. Nighton had, with the same object, penetrated some twenty or twenty-five miles into the interior, and found it impracticable. Nighton had returned, but Barham was yet in the mountains, endeavoring to force a passage; they had been absent six days, with seven wagons in their train, intending to go as far as they could, and if found to be impracticable, to return and go down the river.10 We succeeded in persuading fifteen families to accompany us in our trip over the mountains, and immediately made preparations for our march. On the afternoon of the fourth of October, our preparations were announced as complete, and we took up our line of march; others in the mean time had joined us, and should we fall in with Barham, our train would consist of thirty wagons. But before preceeding with a description of this route, I will enter into a detail of the difficulties undergone by the company of two hundred wagons, which had separated from us at Malheur creek, under the pilotage of Mr. Meek. It will be remembered that S.L. Meek had induced about two hundred families, with their wagons and stock, to turn off at Malheur, with the view of saving thereby some one hundred and fifty miles travel; and they had started about the last of August. They followed up Malheur creek, keeping up the southern branch, and pursuing a southern course. For a long time they found a very good road, plenty of grass, fuel and water; they left these waters, and directed their course over a rough mountainous country, almost entirely bereft of vegetation, were for many days destitute of water, and when they were so fortunate as to procure this indispensable element, it was found stagnant in pools, unfit even for the use of cattle; but necessity compelled them to the use of it. The result was, that it made many of them sick; many of the cattle died, and the majority were unfit for labor. A disease termed campfever, broke out among the different companies, of which many became the victims. They at length arrived at a marshy lake, which they attempted to cross, but found it impracticable; and as the marsh appeared to bear south, and many of them were nearly out of provisions, they came to a determination to pursue a northern course, and strike the Columbia. Meek, however, wished to go south of the lake, but they would not follow him. They turned north, and after a few days' travel arrived at Deshutes or Falls River. They traveled up and down this river, endeavoring to find a passage, but as it ran through rocky kanyzns, it was impossible to cross. Their sufferings were daily increasing, their stock of provisions was rapidly wasting away, their cattle were becoming exhausted, and many attached to the company were laboring under severe attacks of sickness;— at length Meek informed them that they were not more than two days' ride from the Dalles. Ten men started on horseback for the Methodist stations, with the view of procuring provisions; they took with them a scanty supply of provisions, intended for the two days' journey. After riding faithfully for ten days, they at last arrived at the Dalles. On their way they encountered an Indian, who furnished them with a fish and a rabbit; this with the provision they had started with, was their only food for the ten days' travel. Upon their arrival at the Dalles they were so exhausted in strength, and the rigidity of their limbs, from riding, was so great, as to render them unable to dismount without assistance. They reached the Dalles the day previous to our arrival. At this place they met an old mountaineer, usually called Black Harris,11 who volunteered his services as a pilot. He in company with several others, started in search of the lost company, whom they found reduced to great extremities; their provisions nearly exhausted, and the company weakened by exertion, and despairing of ever reaching the settlements. They succeeded in finding a place where their cattle could be driven down to the river, and made to swim across; after crossing, the bluff had to be ascended. Great difficulty arose in the attempt to effect a passage with the wagons. The means finally resorted to for the transportation of the families and wagons were novel in the extreme. A large rope was swung across the stream and attached to the rocks on either side; a light wagon bed was suspended from this rope with pulleys, to which ropes were attached; this bed served to convey the families and loading in safety across; the wagons were then drawn over the bed of the river by ropes. The passage of this river occupied some two weeks. The distance was thirty-five miles to the Dalles, at which place they arrived about the 13th, or 14th of October Some twenty of their number had perished by disease, previous to their arrival at the Dalles, and a like number were lost, after their arrival, from the same cause. This company has been known by the name of the St. Joseph company; but there were persons from every state of the Union within its ranks. Illinois and Missouri, however, had the largest representation. The statements I have given are as correct as I could arrive at, from consultation with many of the members. This expedition was unfortunate in the extreme. Although commenced under favorable auspices, its termination assumed a gloomy character. It has been stated that some members of the Hudson's Bay Company were instrumental in this expedition, but such is not the fact. Whilst I was at Fort Hall, I conversed with Captain Grant respecting the practicability of this same route, and was advised of the fact, that the teams would be unable to get through. The individual in charge at Fort Bois also advised me to the same purport. The censure rests, in the origin of the expedition, upon Meek; but I have not the least doubt but he supposed they could get through in safety. I have understood that a few of the members controlled Meek, and caused him to depart from his original plan. It was his design to have conducted the party to the Willamette Valley, instead of going to the Dalles; and the direction he first traveled induced this belief. Meek is yet of the opinion that had he gone round the marshy lake to the south, he would have struck the settlement on the Willamette, within the time required to travel to the Dalles. Had he discovered this route, it would have proved a great saving in the distance. I do not question but that there may be a route found to the south of this, opening into the valley of the Willamette. But I must again return to the subject of my travels.","journal_id":128,"lat":45.596083,"location":"Same location as previous, OR","long":-121.179,"name":"Joel Palmer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-0.847376,-3.780519]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":987,"date":"5/3/1880","entry":"Left North Platte in the morning and struck up the South Platte.

On entering Burnt-river Canyon, however, it meandered a good deal, and often followed the bed of the stream to avoid the labor of cutting through the dense thicket. It was also steep climbing to get out at the head of the canyon. In doing so we overtook part of Woodcock's company, who left us the morning after our military organization. They had done better than we, both in expedition of movement and in keeping up their food supply. From Mr. Loomis we purchased a little buffalo pemmican — ten pounds I think. This was reduced to a very little by our supper and breakfast at Lone Pine camp on the bank of Powder River; but some wretch had cut the noble landmark, the pine tree, down. At noon we gave our horses an hour to graze on the top of the hill overlooking Grand Ronde Valley. We had not, been in the habit of eating a midday lunch , and the little we had would not go far in abating our hunger. We took a vote on the proposition to eat it then and trust to Providence, and it carried five to one; after which we were out of food for the third time since leaving Fort Hall. Getting our horses we led them down the exceedingly steep and rough trail. About halfway down this long hill we passed two prairie chickens which lit on the limb of one of two fir trees, the first of this timber we saw. A rifle shot got one of the birds. At the foot of the hill the trail was close against ash timber and brush, and here we found a family of pheasants — another shot got another bird. But we had not advanced more than half a mile till we were hailed by a party of Oregon men camped a little off the trail. They invited us to stop and camp with them. It proved to be James Waters, William C. Dement, and — . Rice, thus far out to meet the immigration, Mr. Waters expecting to meet his family, and we were compelled to give him the disap- pointing information that his family was not on the way. We dressed our game and placed it on to cook. Our Oregon friends gave us rice and tea and sugar, and things looked generally pleasant as the result of our trust in Providence. To complete our satisfaction a cavalcade of Indian women now came along with horses loaded with camas roots. We purchased some fresh roots to boil with our game; but the squaws knowing better than we how to use camas, brought out some cakes of camas bread they had left over from their lunch. These cakes were eight to ten inches broad and one and a quarter thick, of brown color, and texture like new cheese, but more glutinous, with a sweet and agreeable taste ; undoubtedly a very nutritious food. We bought all the women had, fishhooks being our money.

One of them was on foot, and they had no provisions. Our store was exhausted, when at the crossing of Goose Creek we met a guide of the Hudson's Bay Company and a lay brother of the Catholic Church, to guide the priest we had seen at Fort Hall to the Missoula country. We mentioned our condition as to food supply, and asked the chances to purchase of Indians ahead. The leader replied, \"It is not good, gentlemen, this side of Salmon Falls. I have a dozen salmon skins, however; and as we will reach Fort Hall tomorrow night, we'll make six do us; I will give you half.\" He would not hear of pay. \"No, gentlemen ; good-bye, and better luck to you.\" Before we got to Salmon Falls, however, we were hailed by a middle-aged Indian, who held up a large salmon to show his meaning. We purchased the fresh fish and a few dried skins, and some roe dried in the smoke of the camp fire. We found fishhooks good small change for the purchase of fish — much better than money would have been. West of the American Falls the river bed (Snake) falls rapidly below the plain on the south side. At one point the fire had been got to run in the thin grass and sagebrush, and the Indians were harvest- ing large black crickets, grasshoppers, and small black lizards. We met a small party of Indian families going eastward, seemingly on a hunting expedition. They had young deer heads prepared to use as decoys, and bows and arrows as arms. They looked poor and inferior as compared with some who passed us near Fort Bridger, returning from buffalo hunting. One party came to us with a small bay horse for sale, and Mr. Bamsay bought it and mounted Mr. Murray, who was on foot. Near Salmon Falls we came upon a young man utterly nude ; he was lying against a steep sand bank apparently en- joying a very hot sun bath. He was a finely formed young animal as he stood up with glistening skin, smiling an apology for having left his clothes at home, apparently. The canyon was so deep that the dome-like wickiups below looked like meadow mouse nests rather than human habitations. Soon after leaving the young man standing in the road looking after us, we descended a very steep and rough trail to the lower part of Salmon Falls, and found ourselves near three of those nest-like houses. We could see people busy along the river on both sides above us, but found only one very old woman housekeeper. She quickly understood that we wanted food, and led us into the lodge. A large unevenly molded earthenware pot stood near some live coals of burning sagebrush. She filled for each of us bowls of fish soup, which our hunger made taste good to us. The bowls, woven of plaited grass, seemed to be made soup proof by a fishskin glue. The pot itself took most of my attention, as it seemed to have been made of common brick clay, but had no crack or flaw. It was beyond doubt of Indian manufacture. Wepurchased some salmon roe and skins, and left the old lady well pleased with our payment of fishhooks. Near this point we overtook Major Thorp's company, and camped near by it. One member of this company claimed the horse Mr. Ramsay had bought as having been stolen from him by Indians. One of the party named Durben, not the owner or claimant, talked biggest about taking the horse from us. We truthfully put in the plea of honest purchase in protest. Mr. Durben made a second visit to our camp after we had demurred to giving the horse up, and talked very big about the foolkiller of their company coming and taking in the horse, and some of us if necessary. He was asked to give us fair warning if that was resolved upon — supposing that he was just talking. Long years afterwards the writer learned from William M. Case that Durben's proposition had been seriously discussed in their company, and that he (Durben) was himself the foolkiller, who later lost his life in Cali- fornia by meeting a bigger fool than himself. We crossed the Snake River at the wagon ford below Salmon Falls, and were out of provisions again when we came to where the Boise River debouches from the hills to the plain. The Bannock Indians had a great fishery here, keeping a large drying rack constantly clothed with salmon drying on the skin. When cured these were put up in bales of about eighty pounds weight each, for stor- ing for winter use, or for barter. They used a weir sys- tem of brush to catch the fish. The Bannocks were very friendly, and took so much pains to guide us to where we would get good grass for our horses that some of the boys became suspicious. The man who took this pains stayed with us all night, and parted from us next morning with every appearance of honest kindness. He showed us by signs that the fine horse Clark had got at Bridger in exchange for a mule had been injured chasing buffalo byone of his friends. Leaving this fishery with a good sup- ply, we were shortly overtaken by another party of the same tribe, as we supposed. Some of the young fellows drove their horses by us, yelling in a spirit of mischievous fun. The women came up sedately, leading pack horses. They let us know that they had been out gathering fruit by showing us cakes of what I judged to be choke cher- ries and service berries beaten together and dried in cakes of about four inches across and three quarters of an inch thick. The fishhooks were again successful as a medium of exchange. We passed portions of Boise River that day as rich with salmon, as a food supply, as the plains of the Platte had been with buffalo beef.

The passage of the cascades delayed them only the difference between floating and walking the three miles portage, as Clark, with the rashness which was a strong trait in his char- acter, shot the canoe down that very dangerous piece of river alone. Neither McCarver nor Holman, who knew the rapids and the chances taken, would run the risks and advised our three comrades against doing so. Clark was by nature a man of great courage, and had left the position of ferryman on Grand River, Missouri, to come to Oregon. We renewed our bedfellowship on my arrival at the McCarver Farm, and Clark related with glee and pride his success in shooting the cascades. He told me also of his interview with a British ship captain as his party passed Vancouver. As in both incidents he showed the type of his class, age, and motive, I insert the latter here with my belief that he was much surprised when, thirty years later, I detailed the account to an audi- ence of Oregon pioneers, and he had forgotten ever having told it to me: On arrival at Vancouver, the canoe party found a ship just arrived from London with the usual annual cargo of goods for the Hudson's Bay Company's Pacific Coast trade. Clark had never before seen a seago- ing vessel to remember it, and learned it would not be deemed intrusive to go on board merely to see it. While waiting General McCarver's return from the fort, whither he had gone probably to give Doctor McLoughlin the in- formation he had got from us of the number of immigrants approaching, and to ask in behalf of Clark, Crockett, and myself for the use of a bateau boat in which to assist our friends from The Dalles to theWillamette when they should arrive at the former point. Clark used his leisure by going on the ship alone, and making an inspection from stem to stern. He found himself at last face to face with thecaptain, who, engaged with his log, or ship's accounts, looked up in surprise at the intruder, and addressed him in words to this effect: \"Young man, who are you; and what do you want here?\" Clark, somewhat flushed, answered, \"Sir, I am an immigrant just come down the river.' I do not wish to intrude, but I wanted to see the ship, as I never saw one before to recollect.\" The captain examined his visitor a few moments in silence, and then said, \"Where do you come from and why do you come here?\" He was answered instantly, \"We come from Mis- ouri, across the Rocky Mountains; we've come to settle in Oregon and rule this country.\" The captain took another silent stare, and then replied, \"Well, young man, I have sailed in every quarter of the globe, and have seen the most of the peoples upon it ; but a more uncouth, and, at the same time, bolder set of men than you Americans I have never seen.\" ","journal_id":127,"lat":45.38531,"location":"Tualatin","long":-122.766,"name":"John Minto"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-4.237515,-9.178426]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1194,"date":"7/23/1824","entry":"Travelled over a very hilly broken broken country; encamped in the mountain without  water; saw a number of herds of sheep and cattle.

We found two oxen almost buried in the mud. At 5:15 we left this miserable place. The first mile was very bad traveling, there being several steep pitches to pass over. A number of the brethren went ahead with picks and spades to improve the road. We traveled three and three-quarters miles and halted at 7 a.m. for breakfast near a small stream of clear spring water. The feed is good but there is no wood. Brother Kimball and Benson state that, when they were riding ahead last evening to find a camp ground, they saw six men suddenly spring up out of the grass, with blankets, that looked like Indians. They turned their horses and rode in a parallel direction to the road. The brethren also kept on their course. After going a short distance one of the supposed Indians left the rest and rode toward the brethren and mentioned with his hand for them to go back. They went on and paid no regard to him. When he discovered that he could not bluff them off, he turned his horse and run for the others, and all put spurs to their horses and galloped off. They soon descended a ridge and were soon out of sight. Brother Kimball and Benson run their horses to the top of the ridge and discovered a camp about a mile off. The brethren were satisfied that those Indians were Missourians, and that they had taken this plan to keep us back from this camp ground. It is considered an old Missouri trick and an insult to our camp, and if they undertake to play Indian games, they might meet with Indian treatment. Their camp left here a little before we arrived this morning. It is President Young's intention to press on a little faster, and crowd them up, to see how they will like it. We have learned from one of the emigrants in the rear that Andrew Gibbons staid with them last night, and that when he arrived at the springs he found a Missouri company hate and us gone. He told them where the buffalo was and they went and got it. At 9:15 we proceeded on our journey, and after traveling three miles we arrived at Willow Springs and halted a little while to water. The spring is about two feet wide and the water about ten inches deep; clear, as cold as ice. The grass is very good here and it is very good at the camp ground. About a quarter of a mile beyond the spring we ascend a hill, which is about one mile from the foot to the top of it, and the ascent very steep. From the top of the hill snow can be seen on the top of the mountains a long distance off. The Red Buttes appear only a few miles distant. Three-quarters of a mile further we found good feed, but no wood or water. We traveled one and one-quarter miles and came to a heavy slough. About a mile from this place we ascended a very steep bluff, and at 2:45 we stopped to feed in a ravine, where the grass is very good and a good stream of water about a quarter of a mile south of the road, but there is no wood. We have traveled nine miles this forenoon over a barren, sandy country, there being no feed only in spots as above mentioned. At 5 o'clock we proceeded on our journey, and after travelling two and one-half miles we descended to the bottom land again, and saw a small stream a little to the left of the road, where there is plenty of feed. We crossed a stream one and three-quarter miles further, of clear water about six feet wide and one foot deep, but there is neither grass nor timber on its banks. After traveling seven miles this afternoon we turned off of the road to the left, and at 8:20 we found our camp ground, as selected by Brother Kimball, on a ridge near the above mentioned creek, about a quarter of a mile from the road. Our travel this afternoon was seven and one-quarter miles, exclusive of turning off from the road, and during the day twenty miles. There is no wood and we have to use the sage roots for cooking, as it grows wild in abundance in this region. Brothers Woodruff and J. Brown went ahead this morning and we have not seen or heard of since.","journal_id":133,"lat":42.552574,"location":"20mi","long":-106.769,"name":"Howard Egan"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-5.167892,-2.224846]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1302,"date":"6/21/1847","entry":"This morning was very fine and warm, and at 8:35 a.m. we proceeded on our journey. After traveling three and one-quarter miles we came to a bed of saleratus, which was a quarter of a mile across, and on which were several lakes of salt water. This place looks swampy and smells bad. Lorenzo Young gathered a painful in a short time, and tested its qualities, which he considers very good. It is reported by travelers that there is poison springs in this region, but we have not seen any. It is probably the brackish water, which tastes some of saleratus, that make them call it poison springs. We passed along a little further and saw two more lakes of the same nature, with the banks mostly white with saleratus. At 12 o' clock we arrived on the bank of Sweet Water, having come nine and one-half miles over a very sandy road, destitute of wood, water and feed. The distance from the upper ferry on the Platte is forty-nine miles. There has formerly been a ford here, but lately it has been crossed about a mile higher up. The river is probably about seven or eight rods wide and about three feet deep at the fording place, but much deeper in the other places. The current runs very swift and the water tastes good, but is some muddy. On the river there is plenty of good grass, but no wood. There is plenty of wild sage, which answers for fuel. Brother G. Billings and Baird went back about a half mile and got a bucket of the saleratus. Brother Kimball was ahead looking out a camp ground and he and Brother Richards were close to Independence Rock, about a half a mile ahead, when they waved their hats for us to come on there, but we did not see them. The day has been very hot and no wind, which makes it very unpleasant traveling. Here Brother Woodruff and Brown passed the camp. They had passed the night with one of the Oregon companies. There are many huge hills or ridges and masses of granite rock in this neighborhood, all destitute of vegetation, and presenting a very wild and desolate as well as romantic appearance. The brethren killed two snakes here. Some of the brethren went ahead to Independence Rock, which is about a half mile west of where we encamped. The river runs within about three rods of the rock and runs about a west course, while the rock runs a northwest direction. It is a barren mass of bare granite, more so than any others in this region, and is probably 400 yards long and 80 yards wide, and about 100 yards perpendicular height, as near as Brother Clayton could judge. The ascent is very difficult all around, but the southwest corner appears to be easier to ascend. There are hundreds of persons who have visited and painted their names with different colored paint, both male and female. At 3 p.m. we proceeded on our journey. Brother Clayton put up a guide board opposite the rock with the following inscription: ʺTo Fort John, 175 3/4 miles. Pioneers, July 21st, 1847, W.R.ʺ Dr. Richards request that his brand be put on all the signboards that the Saints might know them, as his brand is generally known by the Church. After traveling one mile beyond the rock we crossed the river, all the wagons crossing with difficulty. We then continued a southwest course and traveled four and one-half miles when we were opposite to the Devil's Gate, which is a little further, where the road passes between two high ridges of granite rocks, leaving the surface of about two rods of level ground on each side of the road. The road then bends to the west, and a quarter of a mile further we passed over a small creek about two feet wide, but very bad to cross, it being very deep and muddy. We proceeded on a short distance and found our encampment at 6:35 on the banks of the river, having traveled seven and three-quarters miles this afternoon and during the day fifteen and one-quarter miles. The feed is very good here, but wood is scarce. I fell in some of the brethren, and we went up in the company. Where we arrived at the top of the east rock we found it perpendicular. The river runs between two high rocky ridges, which were measured by Brother Pratt and found to be 309 feet and 6 1/2 inches high and about 200 yards long. The river has a channel of about three rods in width through the pass, which increases in swiftness, and it dashes furiously against the huge fragments of rocks which has fell from the mountains, and roaring can be heard a long distance. It has truly a romantic appearance, and the view over the surrounding country is very sublime. The Sweet Water mountains show high and appear spotted with snow, the high barren rocky ridges on the north side of the river, seem to continue for many miles.","journal_id":133,"lat":42.549539,"location":"15mi","long":-107.032,"name":"Howard Egan"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-5.47357,-2.291662]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1303,"date":"6/22/1847","entry":"The morning was fine, and at 7:20 we continued our journey, and when about 200 yards from where we encamped we crossed a very crooked creek, about six feet wide, descending from the southwest, After traveling about three miles over a very heavy sand road, we crossed another creek about two feet wide. Brother Lorenzo Young broke an axel, which detained him for some time. One of the Oregon company came up, and one of them took Brother Young's load into his wagon, and spliced his axletree, which enabled him to follow the camp. At 11:55 we halted on the bank of the river. During the halt Brother Pratt took an observation and found the latitude to be 42 degrees 28 minutes 24 seconds. The Oregon company passed us while we were getting up our teams. At 2:45 we started again, the road leaving the river, and traveled about half a mile, passing a large lake on our left. After about five and three-quarters miles we crossed a creek about six feet wide and a foot deep, the banks on either side being steep and sandy. The banks of the creek are lined with wild sage, which is very large and thick, instead of grass. Brother Kimball named it Sage Creek. After passing the creek one and three-quarters miles we arrived again at the banks of the river, and continued to travel near to it, and on three and three-quarters miles we crossed a stream three feet wide, but not to be deepened for water. At 7:45 we encamped at the foot of a very high gravely hill and near the river, having traveled this afternoon ten and three-quarters miles, and during the day twenty and three-quarters miles, mostly over a sandy road. The feed is very good here, and is well worth traveling a few miles further for. Brothers Barney and Hancock have each killed an antelope today, but there appears to be no buffalo in the neighborhood. The camp is all well and we continue to be prospered on our journey.","journal_id":133,"lat":42.455888,"location":"21mi","long":-107.438,"name":"Howard Egan"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-15.484824,-3.757846]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1487,"date":"12/2/1846","entry":"Continues to snow wind W sun shineing hazily thro the clouds dont snow quite as fast as it has done snow must be over six feet deep bad fire this morning.

one mile from the fort and that we had to ford This is a wide clear swift running stream and so deep that we had to block up our waggon beds in order to keep our provisions dry in crossing We did not cross till we watched while other trains that had got here earlier had to take thier turn And there was quite a number Our hearts were light in anticipation of getting to the fort There among this multitude all was excitement to get across Something was ahead It seemed like a galy day as a convention 4 of July or some such time was at hand to which we were agoing to have a recreation Then the sound of the cannon that was fired to greet the arrivle of Major Sanderson came abooming from the fort the hills around echoed the report one from another and it dwelt long among them before it died away It was soul stirring their successive reports in this expansive wild Ft Laramy is a post established for the mere purpose of carrying on trade with the indians it appears that some seasons there is a good deal of trade carried on here We had met two trains loaded with buff aloe skins and furs on our way We found this to be a place of no verry imposing apperence It is a structure made out of A dogies or sun dried bricks This is so built as to form a square court in its center The doors to each seperate room opens on the side of the court or yard There are two large doors sufficiently big to admit a waggon These are on two opposite sides and are the entrences into the fort The cannon that we heard firing is the only piece belonging here but is small and light and can easily be run from one door to the other It is impossible for emigrants to sell any thing here that they would wish to get rid of there have been too many hevy loaded teams here before this And these men at the fort will take nothing unless it is given to them And yet for things that they have to sell and which emigrant buy they ask a high price vinegar they sold at 25 cents a pt The inhabitants of this fort consist at this time of about 18 or 20 traders and trappers regular old hosses as they termed themselves Some of these have squaw wives living with them here at the fort and are a rough outlaw dish whisky drinking looking set having neither the affections or desires of more civilized men Major Sanderson is to take possession of the fort with his command and thus turn it into a military post One stage of our long journey is now performed The wide plain on the eastern side of the rocky mountains have been crossed one of its snow capped peaks we saw two days since This is Larmies peak It appears as if it were yet 100 miles off But we are at the base of the lower ranges and our next journeying will be among them In our journeying over the plains we have the most of the time had good road be shure we had some bad places in crossing streams But could it it be supposed that a natural road 700 miles in length would be free of them The places where we had so much dificulty in goin down and up banks and over streams could have been made convieniently posible had a little labour been bestowed upon them But every party would go over a bad place without trying to make it better and a party when they would get over would leave the others to do the same Our frequent hard rains some times made the roads mudy but in the aggrate I think that they helped the road in more times than they injured it Where the roads were sandy the rains helped to settle them and made them hard and the roads were soon dry after a rain We had been a month and 8 days from the misouri line a coming here Thus averaging about 18 miles a day For the whole way since we started we have never lacked for company At times there were at times 5 or 6 hundred waggons in one unbroken string These waggons were each drawn by from 3 to 5 yoke of cattle The mule and horse waggons were drawn by two spans each sometimes by 3 These teams hauled baggage for between 2 and 3 thousand people In fact the teams were so thick in many places as to considerbly retard each others progress The collery has been among the trains that were in company with us Ever since we started untill the 2 last days yet there has been none died out of our company from it In some it has raged fearfully A great many hours of the day we could see companies stoped on the side of the road to burry thier dead We pased one grave with 3 buried in it We could hear of it prevaling to a more alarming extent in companies that were further back on the road than in those that were with us There have been a great many acidents hapend by foolishly handling guns and pistoles And putting loaded guns in waggons has been a great source of mischief by this A great many have been killed and others seriously wounded The most of the water that we have used has been bad Sometimes we have come across good springs or runs of water but the most of the water has been out of pools of rain water or out of the mudy waters of the Platt We have generally found plenty of grass for our cattle After stopping and grazing our cattle We would secure them at night by forming a yard or enclosure by driving our waggons around in a circle This enclosure we called a corell A company from Hebron traviled with us most of the way and joined with us in making our corell Thier waggons added to the number of waggons So in company we had 2 (companies) to form with Each company also sent out an equal number of men to guard the cattle The tribes of Indians that we saw were Shawnee Caw Pottawotamies and the Sioux We passed the territory of the Pawees and one or two other tribes without seeing an Indian The fear of the Calvary kept a good many of them off The sight of game was not as frequent as we were led to expect from the reports of

The morning is pleasant— We have found  some grass a few miles above camp, and Col. Cook has  given orders that we halt here today to refresh the stock as  there is only one feed of corn left. We are now distant from  Green River about 28 miles and have nearly accomplished a  march which will reflect credit upon our gallant Colonel.  Under all the circumstances no expedition has ever been  conducted with more sound judgment more order and complete  success than this— Under ordinary circumstances and  under the conduct of an inexperienced officer, the expedition  would have proved a complete failure. A march across this  desert country at the most pleasant season of the year is one  of great toil and sacrifice, but, at the most rigorous season  it is almost a miracle— without the loss of a single man and  the sacrifice of a comparatively small amount of stock— The  storm and the intense cold the almost entire want of fuel,  grass and water, have offered no impediment to the progress  of the march. The Bugle sounded to the march and all were  in motion. The brave Col. at the head of his Command faced  the storm and ploughed through the snow drifts. Determined  to accomplish the object of his duty, he suffered nothing to  deter him from his purpose. The lives of his soldiers and the  property of his government were in his hands and he knew not  what suffering a day's delay might bring upon him. The  mountains had to be crossed for return was impossible. The  forage for his animals was nearly exhausted and the little  grass to be found was buried beneath the snow— He persevered and l)as been crowned with success— Great credit  is due to Lieut. Beaufort the Regimental Quartermaster who  never shrank from his duty— I have often seen him when a  wagon was overturned laboring in the snow to right it again  and to prevent delay in the march— Not a murmer was heard  from an officer or soldier, all shared alike in the toils and  privations consequent upon so severe a march— No person  who has not made the trip across the plains has any correct  notions in regard to it— The descriptions given of it by journalists  are so meager that those who have read these descriptions  and then travelled over the road acknowledged that they  had not the most remote conception of the country— What  is called the Pass in the Rocky Mountains is not as most per^  sons suppose, a narrow passway through frightful over-hanging  mountains with wild streams dashing down their acclivities,  but on the contrary it is a scarcely perceptible ascent,  und when the summit is reached the traveller is not aware of  it and frequently asks where is the Pass? The Pass may be  said to commence at Independence Rock on Sweet Water following  the Valey through which that stream flows more than  one hundred miles before it reaches the most elevated point,  the Pacific Spring, where the water commences flowing to  the west. The Valey of Sweet Water varies in width from  12 to 30 miles and is walled in on each side by a low chain  of Rocky Moutains only some few hundred feet in height  which give to the mountains their name. These mountains  are called the Wind River Chain as they run from Wind River  which flows into the Missouri on the north— They are in  sight long after crossing the south Pass as they stretch away  on the north. There is no road of the same length that is  more level, running most of the time over a firm smooth gravelly  surface— The descent on the western slope is more gradual  than on the East spreading out into a vast desert plain  covered with sage, which gives it more the character of  sterillity than if it had no vegetation at all upon it  —  We are now near the place where one of the trains was  burned on Big Sandy.","journal_id":147,"lat":42.029055,"location":"","long":-109.572277,"name":"William A.

We continued down the Columbia River on a very dangerous road, on the side of hills, where, if a horse should stumble, he would fall two hundred feet down into the river. We traveled through large white sand banks, and passed the falls, where the Indians catch great quantities of fish. We staid among these Indians awhile. They seem very religious. We prayed together, and gave them some bread. They sung and prayed before they ate, and then returned thanks afterwards. At this place, some of our Methodist missionaries had preached. We crossed a small river below the falls, where, while we stopped to let our animals graze, we had some of our articles stolen by the Indians. We passed the \"Dalles,\" or Narrows, where the Columbia River is contracted to not more than twenty yards wide. Around the place the Indians are numerous. Shortly after this, we arrived at the Methodist mission where brother Daniel Lee, brother Perkins, brother Brewer, and their families are stationed. They are making some progress among the Indians. I was truly glad to see a Methodist house, and see the Methodist people once more. They were very good to us, and supplied us with provisions, free of charge. I was often invited to eat with them, but not to sleep in the house.

flag unfurled over it first by N. J. Wyeth in 1834. But Wyeth had been crushed out by competition with the Hudson's Bay Company, and was compelled to sell after a few years of desperate struggle, and the post was now in control of Alexander Grant as chief trader for that company. It was at this date the trade center of a hungry land. Its supplies of breadstuff's came from Western Oregon, six hundred miles west, and its meats from the buffalo country about as far east. It was in the natural passway of native tribes to and from the hunting grounds, and west of it had been the land of privation from prior to its first traversing by white men in 1811. Clark arriving soon after I had disposed of the lus- cious treat of berries, we went together to the fort. As in the most of stockades built for trade purposes, there was one small common room used by trade transients. Mr. Grant came into this shortly after we arrived, and seemingly concluded at a glance that we were not worth much commercially, as without speaking to either of us, he returned to his quarters before I could state my business. Being both bashful and proud, we told no one of our hunger, but went out some two miles to the Port- neuf , hoping to kill some ducks and find better grass for Clark's horse than was to be had near the fort. But ducks were scarce and wild and we lay downsupperless again. But a lucky shot floated within range of our camp fire next morning. At the report of the gun Clark wheeled like a retriever and bounded into the pool waist deep; rushed back to the fire and held the duck in the blaze by its feet, rapidly changing hands, till the feathers came off in scorched masses, bringing much of the skin, and roughly pulling the bird apart, gave part of it to me. The cooking of that duck was never grumbled at. We then made our way back to the .fort, arriving just as the Owens Brothers, and James Marshall, who later discovered gold in California, drove up to the fort gate. Henry Owens, with whom Marshall went subsequently to California to get cattle to graze the Willamette Valley, was driving that day, and we told him we had eaten nothing but a raw duck in three days. \"Well, boys,\" said big Henry, \"there's a few pones of cold bread, and I can cut you some trim side bacon; that's the best I can do here and now.\" With thanks, we got a good square meal. They drove out to the Portneuf for grass ; but their arrival had waked the trade habit of Grant, and I then had opportunity to show him the gun I proposed to give for a saddle horse. Grant was, I think, a coarser man than Bridger, but carried more outside polish of manner. He gave me fair treatment in trade,however, furnishing a strong saddle horse for my gun, and finding I could get the bullet moulds for it, gave me an Indian saddle for that. I had just completed my trade when other members of the Saunders party drove up, ours closely following. What I observed here in the next few minutes greatly surprised me. As our train drove up to the gate of the stockade more people came out from the establishment than I supposed could he housed there. I had been inside twice and had seen but a couple of rough mountain men, one of whom told me he was a hatter by trade and pursued his calling there from foundation principles, catching his own furbearing animals or using the fine hair of the wolf. Among the many others I had not yet seen was Pegleg Smith, a man widely known as one of the most reckless of his class — the Rocky-mountain men. He was now neatly dressed in navy blue, and would have been judged a steamboat captain in Saint Louis. Having heard of him from my friend Clark, who had seen him while visiting relatives in Missouri, I was wondering over his neat appearance, when a Catholic priest came out, and Mr. Smith passed before him, lifting his hat and receiving a few low spoken words which I supposed was such a blessing as would be given on a feast day in the City of Mexico. Reverend Father Cave, a Baptist minister, was asking Captain Grant if the land around the fort would not re- spond to cultivation with crops. Mr. Grant said he could not tell ; it had not been tried, to his knowledge. Father Cave declared his conviction that with irrigation it would yield rich harvests. He then asked whether we could get to the Columbia River with wagons. Grant's reply was, in substance : \"Mr. Cave, it's no use my answer- ing your question. It's just about a year since a lot of people came here just as you have done and asked me the same question. I told them ' No ; that we found it very difficult to pass the narrow trails with our pack ponies.' They went on, just as you will do : just as if I had not spoken a word, and the next I heard of them they were at Fort Walla Walla. You Yankees will do any- thing you like.\" Then Father Cave seeing Mr. Grant was becoming annoyed led the way out to the Portneuf , where the coarse sedge grass was plentiful and the ground damp and easeful for the cattle. Mr. Grant had handed out to Captains Morrison and Shaw a letter written by P. H. Burnett of the immigration of 1843, to the effect that if for any cause there was likely to be suffering before the families could reach the Willamette and we would let it be then known, relief would be sent. Both Morrison and Shaw had heard Burnett speak on Oregon in Missouri. Pegleg Smith advised against so small a number as three attempting to reach the Willamette Valley in advance of the wagons, and Clark weakened for awhile, but Crockett and I kept to our intent, and he joined us. So we set off on our new venture across \" Six Hundred Miles of Hun- grie Land ' ' — \" Through the land of savage foes See the long procession goes Till It camps by the Columbia of the West ; Where the mountains block the stream, And the cascades flash and gleam, And the sun sinks to his distant ocean rest. \"Tramp, tramp, tramp, the trains keep marching; At length the deadly plains are passed ; But there's still the river trail And the Cascade Range to scale ; — Then the fair Willamette homes are reached at last.\" ","journal_id":127,"lat":43.019208,"location":"Fort Hall","long":-112.634,"name":"John Minto"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-13.672317,-2.780815]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":237,"date":"9/5/1846","entry":"Saturday, September 5—Arrived at the place where the Oregon road leaves the California road and Mary's River—6—1,831 miles.","journal_id":129,"lat":40.691,"location":"Oregon road leaves Califonia road (6 miles)","long":-118.223,"name":"Virgil K.

We made camp in a brush patch, with songs for supper. Clark staked his horse with a long buffalo hide rope; but we found, after ceasing our songs, that something was making the horse restless, which continued until past midnight, after which we got a little sleep. But the dawn showed us the rope cut within six feet of where we lay in the brush, and the horse gone. We accordingly, carrying the saddle and Clark's blanket, took the horse's trail, and found the horse quietly feeding about three quarters of a mile from where he left us, with about seven feet of the rope attached to his neck. The wolves had taken twentyfive to thirty feet of rope for their supper. There seemed no other kind of wild life but wolves. Soon after Clark got his horse saddled and we were on the road toward the fort again, we were overtaken by a native gentleman — defining that word as one who voluntarily assists another without hope of reward: on the Christian principle of doing to a stranger as he would wish the stranger to treat himself. We were beginning to feel the sun's heat, when we were overtaken by a single Indian, well mounted, with a loose horse following him. He looked at Clark's excel- lent mount, and then at me laboriously walking among the brush to avoid the loose, sandy road ; then asked, by signs, if I would ride, and was answered affirmatively. He unloosed his hair rope from his saddle and dashed at the loose animal, catching him at the first throw ; made a bridle of the rope by two half hitches on the lower jaw, took the saddle blanket from under his saddle for me to ride on, and signed to Clark he was in haste and would leave me at the fort. Then we set off in a gallop. I had a heavy buffalo gun carrying, and he soon perceived that riding at such speed without stirrups would be punishment to me. He therefore stopped again, put his saddle onto my horse and took the substitute himself, and away we dashed again. A mile perhaps from the fort our path led across a small stream. Here he stopped, dismounted and washed, took out a small pocket comb and glass, and thus prepared for company. Half a mile more brought us to the camp I suppose he had come to visit at, and we alighted, and he pointed out the location of the fort. I signed that I would wait for my friend before going on, and gave him my thanks; so we parted, he entering the Indian camp a few yards away. As I sat there with my face towards the road we had come, a young girl came to me bringing the new lid of a gallon tin pail heaped with luscious, ripe blackberries. It was a great treat to me. I felt mean at the idea of offering compensation, but ventured to present her a few fishhooks as a means of thanks, and am sure I noted a flash of the eyes denoting pleasure.

President Young is some better, and Father Sherwood is doing well. About 7:30 we again proceeded on our journey, about a south course, and traveled about two miles when Father Case rode up and reported that one of his wagon wheels had broken down. About a mile further we stopped. I went back in company with Brothers Kimball and Benson to help Father Case up. Brother Kimball cut a pole and we lashed under the axletree, and put Brother Benson's horse ahead of the others and hauled him up. We had a light shower this forenoon. The brethren took out most of Father Case's load and we proceeded on our journey, having crossed Ogden's fork this forenoon. The road is stony and rough. This afternoon we crossed the stream seven times, the road winding down through a long narrow ravine, and over hills, and through dense thickets of willows and cottonwood groves. We came about eight miles and crossed a very bad slough. One of the Brother Young's horses mired down. He had to unhitch him to get him out. We then ascended to a steep hill and found a billet, left by Brother Pratt, which read as follows: :July 20th, Canyon Creek, Tuesday Morning: To Willard Richards, G.A. Smith or any of the Saints: From this point it is five miles west to the summit of the dividing ridge. The road will be of moderate descent, and considerable better than the one you have passed over a few miles back. The ravine up which you will go is without water, except two or three small springs, which soon loose themselves beneath the soil. You will pass through groves of quaking asp, balsam, and cottonwood, more than you have seen for many days. From the dividing ridge, you will make a more rapid descent. The hill for a short distance will be quite steep, through straight and smooth. We have descended worse since we left Fort Bridger, you will go down about six miles when you will find a good camping place, the grass being middling good. You will find a small spring about 100 rods after leaving the dividing ridge, which soon loses itself in the soil. The bed of the streams remains mostly dry for the two or three miles, where you will strike a stream nearly one-third as large as the one where I leave this note. Your road in descending will lead through quite a timbered forest, of principally aspens, but some underwood of oak and maple. The soil is extremely rich. About one and one-half miles beyond the camping ground, above mentioned, you will find quite a lengthy hill, to avoid passing through a rocky canyon. You will then descend in a ravine for three or four miles onto a broad and comparatively level valley, and which is probably an arm of prairie, putting up among the mountains from the western outlet. Most respectfully- Orson Pratt.ʺ ʺElders Amasa Lyman, Charles C. Rich, and the saints: I leave you an extract of a letter from Orson Pratt found this at the camping ground, for your benefit and guidance. Yours very truly, Thomas Bullock, Clerk of Pioneer Camp.ʺ We then descended a steep hill and encamped on the banks of Ogden's fork about a quarter of a mile beyond where we found the letter, having traveled seven and one-half miles. The sick are getting better this evening.","journal_id":133,"lat":40.850177,"location":"18mi","long":-111.626,"name":"Howard Egan"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[4.233214,-5.911438]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1610,"date":"5/7/1842","entry":"Returned, 3 more waggons came to camp.","journal_id":125,"lat":38.92985,"location":"Kansas City, MO","long":-94.555,"name":"Medorem Crawford"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12.275918,0.286709]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1899,"date":"8/26/1853","entry":"Friday August 26th.

This morning as soon as we awoke we discovered several squaws seated in the grass near the wagons, with  Buffalo meat which they brought to make further exchanges, but we were amply supplied, and as soon as we could get the  harness on our Mules, started— In a short distance from  Camp the road led again across the bluffs, for a short distance  and turned into the Valey again, after driving for 5 or  6 miles, a part of the time through deep sand. We again halted  to get breakfast under a steep bluff the slopes of which  Avere covered with grape vine and undergrowth. We had  scarcely gotten through our delicious buffalo steak, corn  bread, soked and buttered crackers, and coffee— when we  heard a hal-lo on the other side of the rim, and at first supposed  it to be some white man, but it proved to be an Indian.  In a short time theopposite shore seemed to be covered with  them and some five or six were seen crossing on horse back.  We secured our Mules as quick as possible and commenced  harnessing up, supposing them to be Chiennes but they soon  came up and we discovered that it was the same party of  Sues who had visited us last night— They made signs for  sugar and Tobacco, but we had strained our hospitality too much for our own good^ and could spare them none. Two  of them rode with us several miles and then re crossed the  river to join their party who had struck their lodges and  were moving up the river opposite us— The Bluffs along the  road this morning have been wild in the extreme. They have  been gashed and jagged by the torrents of many centuries  into deep and ragged gulches and huge masses of porous lime  rock, the debris of a ledge winch juts out continuously near  the summit of the bluff being crowned with a deep bed of sand, lie scattered around— We have crossed this morning  frequent wide sandy flats which serve as channels for the  floods of water which are discharged upon the hills and rush  with wild fury down into the Valey. The road again leaving  the river we determined to noon for awhile on good grass before  taking the bluffs again. The road ascended the hill by a rocky circuitous road and after reaching the summit we  had a wide prospect before us of the winding river and the  deep and ragged ravines making down into the river with here  and there a cedar peering up among the rocks— The rocks  seem to be of recent formation and are composed of Carbonate  of lime and silica. A drive of about three hours brought  us to the descent into Ash Hollow. The road led down by a  more gradual slope than that by the upper crossing, and was  the only thing to console us for taking the road that we did, as we had deep sand to contend with and a greater distance  to travel— As soon as we got down into the hollow we  came upon the fresh trail of Col. Cook's Command with 6  Companies of Dragoons and a hundred wagons—They had  packed the roads and we travelled on rapidly. There being  every prospect of a snowstorm. We drove about 5 miles  from the mouth of the Hollow and then turned up into a ravine  running down between tall hills and proceeding some distance  up— We were completely sheltered from the storm,  and soon had bright fires of dry cedar blazing up and illuminating  the ragged hills around","journal_id":147,"lat":41.215788,"location":"","long":-101.830701,"name":"William A.

After nooning for two hours yesterday evening we were in rapid motion over the level plain but contrary to my expectation and to the assertion of the prairie men we came in sight again of the long line of timber on the Blue and descended once more into the valey— The prospect from the ridge was really beautiful. We continued up the valey for some 6 miles when meeting an express wagon from Fort Laramie we were informed that we were still 6 miles from the point where the road leaves the river and 60 miles from Fort Kerney— We continued our drive intending to reach the former point, halt and get our suppers, and when the moon was up drive on to Elm Creek. But night closing upon us, we were compelled to halt and in the act of bringing our wagons into line, (Mr. Livingston's carriage being in advance, and having halted with several others,) just as we had unhooked the check lines and one trace of the lead mules. The team of Mr. Dodson's carriage took fright, darted off, [Mr. Walace] our baggage team followed [took fright] next Mr. L's team then Mr. Walace's, and in a moments time 4 teams were in full flight over the. Mr. Livingston hanging to the reins of his wheel Mules in his efforts to check them, was carried for several hundred yards 'till coming to the verge of an abrupt descent was carried headlong down, and his hold having been broken loose from them— They sweat with headlong fury over the plains— Several of us pursued them as long as we could hear the rumbling of the wheels, but it was so dark that we could not see the track and were forced to give u\\) the pursuit and wait 'till the moon was up. As soon as it was sufficiently light Mr. Hockerty got upon the track and followed up it. They had taken a circle in the prairie until they reached the road and took the back track they then made another circle and had stopped, when he came up with them. The carriage sustained no injury, but one of our lead Mules became detached from the wagon, and we cannot find her although we have been searching in every direction. The baggage team ran several hundred yards when Mr. Kerr & My brother succeeded in stopping them. Tl e other teams swept a circle or two and then halted— Fortunately no accident happened. The fright was occasioned by a verdant youth of our party riding his Mules hastily up into the Camp— It is now one O-Clock and my brother and Mr. Kerr who went in search of the Mules have not yet returned. Our Camp is on the upper side of a beautiful valey formed by a semi Circular bend in the river. We were in a poor condition last night to repel an attack of the Indians had one been made upon us, and we were seriously apprehensive of it. The Sun has at length come out and a strong wind is blowing from the South east—which has dried the road verry much— Mr. Kerr and my brother returned about 3 O-Clock with out having found our little Mule. They traced her to where she had got disengaged from the wagon by breaking her single tree. They continued to pursue her by following her track until they found both ends of the single tree and her track then leading off from the river across a wild desolate and broken Country. They left her to her fate and returned— I felt truly sorry that we had to lose, so kind and docile a creature to be torn to pieces by the Wolves or taken by the more savage Indians. We harnessed up with some sadness but still feeling grateful that our misfortune had not been greater. In a mile or two from our Camp we crossed a straight Creek which ran from the north directly down from the river and in a mile or two from this stream the road ascended the Plain and left the river entirely. We drove on some ten miles to a stream called 32 Mile Creek being that distance from Fort Kerney.","journal_id":147,"lat":40.490649,"location":"32 mile creek","long":-98.431,"name":"William A.

At 5:45 the wagons formed a V, having traveled seven and one-half miles. Six wagons which are a part of the Mississippi Company, that wintered at Pueblo, are here. They have been here two weeks, and they report that the remainder of their company were coming on with a detachment of the ʺMormon Battalion,ʺ who were expected to be paid off and start for this point about the first of June. Two of the brethren came across the river to see us, and they report that nothing has been heard from the main body of the Battalion and that there has been three or four deaths at Pueblo. They said six days ago, having come from Sweet Water in six days and nights, traveling day and night with horses and mules to prevent them from starving to death. Two of their oxen had died for want of feed. The snow was two feet deep at the Sweet Water. It is evident that we are early enough to feed. I make the distance from Winter Quarters to Laramie 541 1/4 miles, which is two miles less than Brother Clayton, and we have traveled it in seven weeks, lacking half a day, and have not traveled but a few miles on Sundays.

The Lord has blessed and prospered us on our journey, and the camp enjoys better health than they did at Winter Quarters. The country begins to have a more hilly and mountainous appearance, and some of the Black Hills show very plainly from here. The timber is mostly ash and cottonwood on the low bottoms on the river, but there are some cedar groves on the bluffs. There is an Indian baby wrapped around with skins, deposited in the branches of a large ash tree, which is in the center of our camp. It is said that this is the mode of burying their dead.

Brother Pratt measured the distance across the river and found it to be 108 yards. The water is deep in the channel, and the current runs about three and one-half miles an hour. There is an old fort near the bank of the river on the other side, and the outside walls are still standing, but the inside is ruins, having been burned. The walls are built of Spanish brick, which is large pieces of tempered clay dried in the sun, and laid up like a brick with mortar. The dimensions of this fort, outside, from east to west, is 144 feet, and form north to south 103 feet. There is a large door fronting the south, which led to the dwellings, fourteen in number when burned. Fort Laramie is about two miles from the Platte, situated on the bank of a stream, called by the same name, which is forty-one yards wide with a very swift current, but not very deep. The brethren, who went to the fort, were informed that we could not travel more than four miles further on the north side of the Platte, the bluffs being impassable with wagons; also that the first year corn was planted there it done very well, but none could be raised since for want of rain as it had not rained for two years there until a few days ago. They, at the fort, have a very good flat boat, and will let us have it for $15, or ferry us over for $18, or 25c per wagon. The trade of this place is principally with the Sioux Indians. The Crow Indians came here a few weeks ago and stole twenty-five horses, which were within 300 yards of the fort and a guard around them. The latitude of this place is 42 degrees 12 minutes 13 seconds. When the brethren returned, they brought the boat with them. Some of the brethren went fishing this afternoon with the seine, in the Laramie Fork, and caught sixty or seventy small fish. The Twelve have decided that Brother Amasa Lyman should go with R.

The buffalo that was killed yesterday evening was divided this morning to the Captains of Tens. This forenoon my time was principally occupied by baking bread and drying beef. President Young and Kimball with several others went ahead on horseback to explore the country, and returned this afternoon, reporting that we pass over the bluffs by going about four miles. The bugle sounded this afternoon for the brethren to come together for a meeting. Brothers H.C. Kimball, Dr. Richards, Markham and Rockwell spoke. The principal part of the time was occupied in exhorting the brethren to faithfulness, and also to obey those whom God had placed in the Church to lead and direct affairs of His Kingdom. Brother Kimball spoke in his usual and interesting and impressive manner, exhorting the brethren to adhere to council and to be humble and prayerful, and the Lord would continue to bless us, and we should be healthy, and not one of us should fall by the way. He also stated that he had traveled much, but never witnessed so much union as there was in this camp. He advised the brethren not to hunt on the Sabbath day, when there was plenty of meat in the camp, but said he had no fault to find. He believed that everybody was trying to do the best they could. He said that if we are faithful the angel of the Lord would go before us and be around about us to ward off harm of the destroyer. He knew the Lord was with us, that our teams were gaining strength and prayers of the Saints were answered. He had prayed that the Indians would not turn to the right and to the left that we might pursue our journey in peace, and asked the brethren if they could get sight of an Indian near? Their answer was, No. He also cautioned them not to use profane language, as the angel of the Lord would turn away from a man that would swear and tale the name of the Lord on vain. The Lord loves a faithful man as a father loves his faithful son. The Spirit of the Lord rested upon him and he spoke with power, which cheered my soul. A number of buffalo herds are in sight, and some of them are making down the bluffs toward our horses. Brother Eric Glines went down to stop them, but they still kept on, when he fired shots at them, all the shots taking effect on one, which ran a little way and then fell. Francis (*Boggs) came with an antelope. The revenue cutter went out and brought the buffalo in, and it was divided among the camp. I have made the pleasure this evening of writing by the light of a candle made by Brother Whipple out of buffalo tallow, and it burns beautifully. This evening was calm and pleasant, and the rules and regulations for the camp (of April the 18th) were read by Brother Bullock. President Young and Kimball took a walk to the bluffs about dark, and returned and went to President Young's wagon and remained in council until after 10 p.m.","journal_id":133,"lat":41.137296,"location":"0mi","long":-101.569,"name":"Howard Egan"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-11.541701,-0.419544]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":481,"date":"7/31/1847","entry":"Movd 18 Miles Campt on Charlotts Creek Bad Road hilly Stony Drove team this day","journal_id":132,"lat":43.436629,"location":"18mi","long":-116.04,"name":"Andrew Jackson Poe Vol 1"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-11.678474,-0.160547]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":482,"date":"8/1/1847","entry":"Movd 18 Miles Campt on Boise River hilly Road Better Soil","journal_id":132,"lat":43.662507,"location":"18mi","long":-116.296,"name":"Andrew Jackson Poe Vol 1"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[1.735191,-4.746659]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1816,"date":"5/18/1853","entry":"Wednesday the 18th.

We started by light this morning and after a drive  of several hours came in sight of Horse Creek, where the two  roads came together and at the same time perceived Col.  Cook's Command of Dragoons and one hundred wagons approaching. We halted to get breakfast and they came up  with us— At the same time we saw Mr. Landon the engineer  who was sent out in advance of McGraw's road expedition.  He was direct from the Wind River and informs us that the  Mormons had burned 4 Government Freight Trains and destroyed  all the provisions. They stated that six hundred Mormons  well mounted, had crossed Green River in different  parties and had got in the rear of the Troops who were encamped  on Ham's Fork, and gathered the wagons together  and after telling the teamsters to take what they wished for  their own use and then destroyed them all. This seems to  be an open declaration of their intention to prohibit the  troops from entering Salt Lake Valey, this Winter. What will be their fate, and ours, is involved in mistery— After  getting breakfast we started again and in a short time came  up with Col. Cook's Command which had passed us, and  halted on there to wait for the one hundred wagons and the  rear guard to come up— We had a short conversation with  the Col. who is a tall, fine looking officer. About ten miles  from Horse Creek we passed the place where Mr. Kingkade  was wounded and all his party killed by the Indians. They secreted  themselves behind some sand hills on the north side of  the road, and as the party were ascending the hill through  the deep sand, took deliberate aim at them and they all fell  at the first fire, 7 in number. Mr. K was the only one that survived and he being shot in a number of places fell from  his mule and the Indian who was following him supposing to  be dead seized his mule and hastened to the mail carriage to  get his part of the plunder and Mr. K. crawled off unperceived  by them and made his way back to Fort Laramie. We  are now nooning on the plain some mile or two from the river  and The Troops are spread out along the bank below us.  They will remain all night, We will proceed. Mr. Ward left  us early this morning anxious to get home and the Mail Wagon  has dropped back with the Troops. We are alone with our  wagon and carriage and 6 of our party. Fort Laramie is distant  about 20 miles. We expect to reach there early tomorrow.  A portion of the plain we have passed over today is literally  covered with Cactus— The wind has been blowing  freshly all day and together with the warm sun, has dried the  road considerably— There is plenty of timber now on the  Platt but the road runs so far from it we cannot make it  available. The sand is verry deep for 4 or 5 miles after  crossing Horse Creek and the flats are verry soft. There is  another large freight train just in advance of us. We encamped  last night at Major Driss' Indian Trading Post. He  is an old mountain trader and tells me that he has been in  this country for 36 years.","journal_id":147,"lat":41.986038,"location":"20 from ft laramie","long":-104.091508,"name":"William A.

Pursuant to a previous threat or promise Capt. Atwood pulled down a tent or two this morning (about an hour and a half after the horn had blown) exposing the serene features of its sleeping inmates much to their chagrin and the amusement of bystanders. Some of the sleepers wanted to draw the tent back over them as a covering but it was \"no go\"—they stood confessed to the \"vulgar gaze.\" Buffalo meat served out this morning first thing—Left Camp about 8:30 a.m., crossed a fine creek[,] nooned on the banks of the Platte and afterwards crossed the North Bluff Fork. Pretty good feed. This evening President Franklin D. Richards and suite (with Bros. Elder and Smith who went in search of the missing cattle) arrived just before dusk in 3 carriages and 2 waggons. They were loudly greeted by the hearty hurrahs of the Saints whom they met after supper when Prest. Willie in a few appropriate remarks introduced Prest. Richards into whose hands he gave the Meeting to be led by him as the Holy Ghost might dictate. Bro. Richards then called on Bro. [blank space] Dunbar for a song. He accordingly sang one of the Songs of Zion. Prest. Richards then addressed the Saints expressing his satisfaction at their having journeyed thus far & more especially with handcarts and congratulating them on the loss of their cattle which he knew had proved and would prove their salvation if they would hearken to and diligently obey counsel to the letter in which event he promised in the name of Israel' s God and by the authority of the Holy Priesthood that no obstacle whatever should come in the way of this Camp but what they should be able by their united faith and works to overcome[.] God being their helper and that if a Red Sea whould interpose they should by their union of heart & hand walk through it like Israel of old dryshod. On the same conditions he promised that though they might have some trials to endure as a proof to God and their Brethren that they had the true \"grit\" still the Lamanites[,] heat nor cold nor any other thing should have power to seriously harm any in the Camp but that we should arrive in the Valleys of the Mountains with strong and healthy bodies and that this should be the case with the aged the sick and the inform [infirm]. He said that next to the Pioneers the Handcart Companies would meet with the most hearty and gracious reception from Prest. Young[,] the Authorities under him and all the Saints in Utah of any Companies that every entered the valley. Prest. Richards said although it was a scheme at which many had already scoffed and which they were yet deriding it was nevertheless the Lord' s plan, a plan which would first puzzle and astonish the nations and then strike terror into their hearts. He encouraged the Saints to live the principles of their religion not only openly before the world but privately in their families and in their intercourse with each other and to scorn all the trials and difficulties which might come in their way, assuring them as the result of such a course that they should find favor with God, and have the confidence of the Brethren things which were to him at all events afar above all the gold, silver and precious stones in the Universe. His words had the tendency to build up, strengthen and encourage the people and seemed to electrify his hearers as it were. The Holy Ghost was felt in its almighty and renovating power during the whole time we were together and the people seconded his sentiments by a hearty \"Amen\" from time to time. Counsellors Daniel Spencer and Cyrus H. Wheelock addressed the Saints in a few stirring remarks bearing testimony to the truth of the words spoken by Prest. Richards. These Brethren exhorted the Saints to obedience, union and brotherly love as they valued their salvation across these Plains. The meeting was then dismissed with prayer by Capt. Atwood after which an account was taken of the number of cows, oxen, waggons, fire-arms, &c., for presentation by President Richards to the First Presidency. Bro. Dunbar sang several songs of Zion during the meeting. Camped for the night on the North Bluff Fork of the Platte—320 miles from Florence.","journal_id":148,"lat":41.189599,"location":"","long":-101.274847,"name":"James G.

The road is rough, rocky, and sideling in many places, and leads through dense thickets of underbrush, and quite a forest of hemlock and poplar trees. At length, after traveling about four miles, we attained the summit of the hill. Here we had a fine view of the snowy mountains and the open country in the distance. We have passed two or three springs during our travel this forenoon. We have begun to descend to a long steep hill (*Big mountain), part of the way we had to chain both wheels. The descent is winding over a rough road, there being many stumps to annoy us. About half way down Brother L. Young's ox wagon turned over. His two little boys were in the wagon at the time, nut providentially escaped uninjured, though part of the load, having been disarranged, rolled upon them, stopping up the entrance, but they were liberated by cutting a hole in the wagon cover. As we descended, the road bearing to the south, we crossed a small stream six times, which ran along the base of the hill through a ravine (*Parley's canyon), and after having come six and one-half miles down a gradual descent we encamped on an open area of ground, spoken of by Orson Pratt, as being an arm of prairie, putting up among the mountains from the western outlet, about 12 o'clock, having come this forenoon about eight and one-half miles. While we were stopped here, J. Pack and Joseph Mathews rode up on horseback. They reported both companies of the brethren to be about twenty-five miles from Salt Lake, which could be seen in the distance to the northwest. When they left this morning the brethren were preparing to move four miles farther, and then stop and commence planting. They say the soil is very rich and fertile. They also brought a letter from O, Pratt, G.A. Smith and W. Richards to President Young, giving an account of the road and the general features of the country, etc. After a halt of about two hours we again proceeded on our journey, going south of west a short distance, the valley becoming more confined in its limits as we advanced, until we began to ascend a long steep hill, which about one and one-half miles to the top. Here Brother Pack and Mathews left us and went ahead. We began to descend a long steep hill (*Little mountain), bearing a southwest course. The most of the way we had to chain both wheels. As we descended the above hill we saw an abundance of service berries. At 5 p.m. we encamped at the base of the hill, on the banks of small clear stream of cool water (*Emigration Canyon creek). Its banks are thickly skirted with quaking asp and cottonwood trees. We have come this afternoon three miles, and during the day eleven and one-half miles. A short time after our arrival at this place, the sky became overcast with clouds, and a strong wind, setting in from the southwest, gives the appearance of a very heavy storm.

About 4 o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the company about four miles ahead, but soon lost sight of them again; and coming to the place where the company had stopped to eat dinner, I alighted, and let my horse feed awhile. At this place, as the company afterwards told me, about two hundred Indians had been seen only an hour before. They had sometimes hung on the rear of the company, and had made some show of attacking those who lingered behind the main body. Awhile before, they had robbed four men of all they had, stripped them naked, and left them in the open prairies to perish before they could get to the white settlements. The company said it was ninety-nine chances to one that I escaped the hands of the Indians, for they had been seen all along where I had come. Surely a wise God controlled the heathens, and protected me; for as I came along the day before, I found a piece of a buffalo robe in the trail, which I thought some of the company had dropped, but after I had put it on my saddle, I saw on the other side of the road  a skin  bag, full of something, which I then knew was an Indian bag.

Praise him, O my soul; for I trusted in him, and he has preserved me. How good it is to converse with the Lord. The company seemed glad that I had made my escape. The company consisted of about fifty. The greater part were bound for California; a few only for Oregon. There was about twenty wagons belonging to the expedition, drawn by oxen.

The rest of the boys followed with their teams and the rest of the stock. I had rather a rough ride, to be sure, but was glad to get away from such a lawless set, which we did by noon. The head teamster did his best by whipping and hollowing to his cattle. He found it of no use and got up into his wagon to take it easy. We left some swearing men behind us. We drove a good ways ahead and stopped to rest the cattle and eat some dinner. While we were eating we saw them coming. All hands jumped for their teams, saying they had earned the road too dearly to let them pass again, and in a few moments we were all on the go again. Had been very warm today. Thermometer at 98 in the wagon at one o’clock. Towards evening there came up a light thunderstorm which cooled the air down to 60.

We find the grazing continues poor. In getting to our encampment, we passed through a large dog town. These singular communities may be seen often, along the banks of the Platte, occupying various areas, from one to five hundred acres. The one in question covered some two hundred or three hundred acres. The prairie-dog is something larger than a common sized gray squirrel, of a dun color; the head resembles that of a bull dog: the tail is about three inches in length. Their food is prairie grass. Like rabbits, they burrow in the ground, throwing out heaps of earth, and often large stones, which remain at the mouth of their holes. The entrance to their burrows is about four inches in diameter, and runs obliquely into the earth about three feet, when the holes ramify in every direction and connect with each other on every side. Some kind of police seems to be observed among them; for at the approach of man, one of the dogs will run to the entrance of a burrow, and, squatting down, utter a shrill bark. At once, the smaller part of the community will retreat to their holes, while numbers of the larger dogs will squat, like the first, at their doors', and unite in the barking. A near approach drives them all under ground. It is singular, but true, that the little screech-owl and the rattlesnake keep them company in their burrows. I have frequently seen the owls, but not the snake, with them. The mountaineers, however, inform me, that they often catch all three in the same hole. The dog is eaten by the Indians, with quite a relish; and often by the mountaineers. I am not prepared to speak of its qualities as an article of food. During the night, a mule, belonging to a Mr. Risley, of our company, broke from its tether, and in attempting to secure it, its owner was repeatedly shot at by the guard; but, fortunately, was not hit. He had run from his tent without having been perceived by the guard, and was crawling over the ground, endeavoring to seize the trail rope, which was tied to his mule's neck. The guard mistook him for an Indian, trying to steal horses, and called to him several times; but a high wind blowing he did not hear. The guard leveled and fired, but his gun did not go off. Another guard, standing near, presented his piece and fired; the cap burst, without discharging the load. The first guard, by this time prepared, fired a second time, without effect. By this time the camp was roused, and nearly all seized their fire-arms, when we discovered that the supposed Indian was one of our own party. We regarded it as providential that the man escaped, as the guard was a good shot, and his mark was not more than eighty yards distant. This incident made us somewhat more cautious about leaving the camp, without notifying the guard.","journal_id":128,"lat":41.048288,"location":"15 miles from previous location along Platte River, NE","long":-100.598,"name":"Joel Palmer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-15.476039,2.565504]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":831,"date":"9/17/1853","entry":"In camp yet.

On the top nods a tuft of scrubby cedars. Upon the south side, a narrow slope between the bluff and river, affords a pass for a footman along the water's edge, while beyond the bluff rises abruptly. Frequently cedar and wild sage is to be seen.

In the exchange of cattle for flour, an allowance was made of from five to twelve dollars per head. They also had horses which they readily exchanged for cattle or sold for cash. The price demanded for horses was from fifteen to twenty-five dollars. They could not be prevailed upon to receive anything in exchange for their goods or provisions, excepting cattle or money.

This tribe is said to be numerous; but in consequence of the continual wars which they have engaged in with the Sioux, Crows and Blackfeet, their numbers are rapidly diminishing. Snake river, which flows within one half mile of the fort, is a clear and beautiful stream of water. It courses over a pebbly bottom. Its width is about one hundred and fifty yards. It abounds in fish of different varieties, which are readily taken with the hook. While we remained in this place, great efforts were made to induce the emigrants to pursue the route to California. The most extravagant tales were related respecting the dangers that awaited a trip to Oregon, and of the difficulties and trials to be surmounted. The perils of the way were so magnified as to make us suppose the journey to Oregon almost impossible. For instance, the two crossings of Snake River, and the crossing of the Columbia, and other smaller streams, were represented as being attended with great danger; also that no company heretofore attempting the passage of these streams, succeeded, but with the loss of men, from the violence and rapidity of the current; as also that they had never succeeded in getting more than fifteen or twenty head of cattle into the Willamette valley. In addition to the above, it was asserted that three or four tribes of Indians, in the middle region, had combined for the purpose of preventing our passage through their country, and should we attempt it, we would be compelled to contend with those hostile tribes. In case we escaped destruction at the hands of the savages, that a more fearful enemy, that of famine, would attend our march; as the distance was so great that winter would overtake us before making the passage of the Cascade Mountains. On the other hand, as an inducement to pursue the California route, we were informed of the shortness of the route, when compared with that to Oregon; asalso of many other superior advantages it possessed. These tales, told and rehearsed, were likely to produce the effect of turning the tide of emigration thither. Mr. Greenwood, an old mountaineer, well stocked with falsehoods, had been dispatched from California to pilot the emigrants through;7 and assisted by a young man by the name of McDougal, from Indiana, so far succeeded as to induce thirty-five or thirty-six wagons to take that trail. About fifteen wagons had been fitted out, expressly for California; and, joined by the thirty-five aforementioned, completed a train of fifty wagons; what the result of their expedition has been, I have not been able to learn.","journal_id":128,"lat":43.016321,"location":"1 mile southwest of fort hall trading post, ID","long":-112.441,"name":"Joel Palmer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-2.723169,-3.06674]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1373,"date":"6/24/1846","entry":"and from their wee traveled a Bowt 10 miles and Came to Scotts Bluffs and from their wee traveled a Bout 7 miles and Camped near Fremonts spring Betuen the divideing Ridge","journal_id":131,"lat":41.8672,"location":"Scottsbluff, Nebraska","long":-103.661,"name":"Hiram O.

The first view we had was of two or three white hillocks or mounds, standing up at different points to the right of the road, and near a grove of cedar and pine timber. One of them is about ten rods long at the base, and three or four rods in width; its elevation is probably twenty-five or thirty feet from the plain in which it is situated. The size of these mounds continually increases, as the water oozes out at different points, and produces a crust which becomes quite hard. The rocks, for miles around, are of the soda formation. Upon those mounds the water is warm. In a small bottom, immediately before reaching the first of these mounds, and about two hundred yards above the road, is a hole about eight feet in diameter; in this is a pool of water, strongly impregnated with soda. I had no means of ascertaining the depth, but believe it to be considerable; at one edge of it the water was boiling and sparkling; it would sometimes swell four inches above the surface. This pool, and others contiguous, affords excellent drinking water; it was cool, and, when sweetened, would compare favourably with any soda water. Just below the mound, and near the grove, is a rapid stream of water, coursing over a rocky bottom, formed by soda. At the crossing of this creek, and below the road, is a morass; and immediately on the bank of the rivulet, is a crevice in the rock, from which a small stream of water issues; this was the best to drink of any I found. After crossing the creek, the distance to the springs generally resorted to is about three-fourths of a mile; they boil up in every direction. Several mounds have been formed, of ten feet in height. The water has found some other passage, and left them to moulder away. The centre or middle of these are concave. The surface of the earth here is some twelve or fifteen feet above the level of the river, the bank of which is of rock, of the soda formation. A grove of cedar and pine timber extends from the river back to the mountain, a distance of two and a half or three miles; the space between the road and the river is covered with grass; but between it and the mountain it is barren of vegetation of any kind. The soda has left a sediment, which is crumbled and loose, with an occasional mound of ten or twelve feet elevation, but no water running. The river here is about one hundred yards in width, and about eighteen inches in depth, running very rapidly. The soda water is bubbling up in every direction, and sometimes rises six inches above the surface of the river. This bubbling extends for near half a mile. A stream comes in from the north at the western edge of the springs, tumbles over the rocks, and finally into the river. Near where one branch of this falls over the rock (it has several passages where the road crosses it) is a circular basin in the rock, being two feet in diameter at the top, but larger below. It was covered with grass; and, in walking along, I barely avoided stepping into it; whilst at its edge the purling or gurgling of the water, as it boils up, apprized me of its vicinity. The surface of the water is about three feet below the top of the rock. The water is cool, much more so than the water of the springs, and is remarkably clear. Three hundred yards below the crossing of this branch, and immediately on the bank of the river, is the Steamboat Spring. The water has formed a small cone of about two and a half feet in height, and three feet in diameter, at the base. A hole of six inches in diameter at the top, allows the water to discharge itself. It swells out at intervals of eight or ten seconds, and sometimes flows four or five feet in disjointed fragments. It is lukewarm, and has a milky appearance; but when taken in a vessel becomes as transparent as crystal. It produces a sound similar to the puffing of a steamboat, but not quite so deep. It can frequently be heard at the distance of a quarter of a mile. About six feet from this is a small fissure in the rock, which is called the escape-pipe or gas-pipe. It makes a hissing noise, corresponding with the belching of the spring. The gas emitted from this fissure is so strong that it would suffocate a person, holding his head near the ground. To the rear of this, across the road, are mounds fifty or sixty feet in height; these were entirely dry. Up this creek is very good grazing for cattle, but there are found some marshy places contiguous. The bottom upon the opposite side of the river is four or five miles in width, and covered with a good coat of grass. The soil looks good; and if the seasons are not too short, would produce well. The mountain upon the south side is covered with heavy pine timber; on the north side but little timber was observed; what little was noticed consisted principally of scrubby cedars. Antelope found in abundance. The water, in many of the springs, is sufficiently strong to raise bread, equally as well as saleratus or yeast. Were it not for their remote situation, these springs would be much resorted to, especially during the summer months. The country is mountainous, and its altitude so great, that the air is always cool, and consequently must be healthy.Companies wishing to remain for a length of time at the springs, would pursue a proper course in driving their cattle over the river, as good grazing can thereby be had.","journal_id":128,"lat":42.655068,"location":"by soda Springs, ID","long":-111.602,"name":"Joel Palmer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-8.61707,-1.616107]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":918,"date":"8/5/1845","entry":"We traveled about nineteen miles. Five miles brought us. to where the road leaves the river, and bears northward through a valley. The river bears to the southward and empties its waters into Big Salt Lake. The range of mountains bounding the north side of the river here comes to within a half mile of it, then bears off to the north, leaving a valley of about seven or eight miles in width between it and a range coming from Lewis River, and extending south towards Salt Lake. The range bounding the south side of the river comes abruptly to the stream at this point, presenting huge and cumbrous masses of basaltic rock, but it is generally covered with heavy timber. At this point two trails are found: one striking west, across the valley, to the opposite side; the other, which is the nearest and best, follows around the point, hugging the base of the mountain for several miles. Two and one half miles distant, and immediately beneath a cliff of rocks by the road side, is to be found a soda pool. A little spring of cool soda water runs out at the base of the rock, and a basin of eight or ten yards in extent, and about two and one half feet high has been formed. Inside of this, is a pool of water; —the material composing the bank around, is of a white color. In a few miles travel, we crossed several spring branches. We then directed our course through the plain for some eight or nine miles, to where we encamped. Our camp was located near a spring branch; but a small quantity of wood was found; grazing was excellent. From where the road leaves the river, the country presents every appearance of having been volcanic at some period. Craters are yet standing in the plain, exhibiting positive evidence of this fact. A large mound has been formed by the lava ejected from this crater. In the centre is a deep cavity; now partially filled, from the falling in of the masses of bank surrounding it. In every direction the eye rests upon fragments of rock, which have been thrown out in a hot and burning condition, many of them melted and united; pieces resembling broken junk bottles or black glass lay scattered over the plain. The valley for ten or twelve miles is covered with stone of this description. In many places the rocks have been lifted or bulged up to an elevation of ten or fifteen feet, the top has been burst asunder, presenting a cavity of eight or ten feet in width, caused by the fragments having been cast out; the depth of the cavity is from twenty to thirty feet, the sides have a black appearance, and exhibit indications of having been burned; at other places the rock had been lifted up, and elevated above the surface of the earth some five or six feet, and about the same in width, having numerous small apertures in it, the centre being concave. The stone forms a complete arch. At other places the rock has been rent, and a chasm of thirty or forty feet in depth and from two to ten feet in width, has been the result. These chasms are about one quarter of a mile in length. The fragments lay in every direction.The country over this plain is rather barren; but at certain seasons of the year, is covered with grass, which during the summer months dies, leaving but little appearance of vegetation. After we had halted for the night, three families who had separated from our company at the Soda Springs, passed us. A few hours had elapsed, and we espied one of their number returning post haste to our camp. When he arrived, he was so paralysed with fear, that it was with difficulty we obtained from him the cause of his alarm. It appeared evident, from his statement, that a party of Snake Indians meditated an attack upon their party. We dispatched a company to their relief , but soon had the gratification to witness the return of their wagons to our camp. It appears that one of their number had marched about two miles in advance of the wagons, when he was discovered by a party of Snake Indians, lurking in the vicinity, who immediately gave him chase, at every step uttering the most terrific yells, and endeavored to surround him; but as he was astride a fleet American courser, he succeeded in outstripping them, and arrived at the wagons in time to prepare for their approach. The wagons were then in a deep ravine, and could not be seen, by the Indians in pursuit, until within seventy-five yards. As soon as the Indians discovered their proximity to the wagons they commenced a precipitate retreat, and the emigrants rejoined our party.","journal_id":128,"lat":42.757632,"location":"19 miles from previous location, (exact location unknown), ID","long":-111.798,"name":"Joel Palmer"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-8.761657,-1.395114]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":919,"date":"8/6/1845","entry":"We traveled this day about fifteen miles.

They brought wheat, corn, potatoes, peas, pumpkins, fish, &c. which they were anxious to dispose of for cloths, calico, nankins and other articles of wearing apparel; they also had dressed deer skins and moccasins; they had good horses, which they offered in exchange for cows and heifers; they would gladly exchange a horse for a cow, esteeming the cow as of equal value. They remained with us throughout the day, and when evening approached returned to their lodges along the river two miles distant. I noticed a few of the Nez Perces (Pierced Noses) tribe of Indians among them. Both of these tribes are under the influence and control of two Presbyterian missionaries, Dr. Whitman and Mr. Spalding, who have resided among them for the last ten years; the former among the Caaguas, which inhabit the country bordering on Wallawalla River and its tributaries, the Blue mountains and Grand Round: the latter among the Nez Perces who inhabit the country lying along Lewis River, and its tributaries, from the eastern base of the Blue Mountains to the Columbia River.

The doctor and lady remained with us during the day; he took occasion to inform us of the many incidents that marked his ten years' sojourn in this wilderness region, of a highly interesting character. Among other things, he related that during his residence in this country, he had been reduced to such necessity for want of food, as to be compelled to slay his horse; stating that within that period, no less than thirty-two horses had been served up at his table. It appears that the soil has never been cultivated until within a few years back; but at this time, so much attention is given to the culture of the soil, which yields abundantly, that the privations of famine, or even scarcity, will probably not again recur. The condition of the savages has been greatly ameliorated and their improvement is chiefly attributable to the missionary residents. They have a good stock of cattle, hogs, sheep, &c., and raise an amount of grain not only sufficient to supply their own wants, but affords a surplus. These tribes differ in their appearance and customs from any we have met. They recognise the change which has taken place, and are not ignorant that it has been effected by the efforts and labor of the missionaries. On the other hand, they acknowledge the benefits derived by yielding to their instructions. They have embraced the Christian religion, and appear devout in their espousal of Christian doctrines. The entire time of the missionaries is devoted to the cause for which they have forsaken their friends and kindred; they have left the comforts of home, and those places which have been endeared by early associations, for the wild wilderness and the habitation of the savage, prompted by those principles of charity and benevolence which the Christian religion always inculcates. Their privations and trials have been great, but they have borne them with humility and meekness, and the fruits of their devotion are now manifest; and if any class of people deserve well of their country, or are entitled to the thanks of a christian community, it is the missionaries.

Got some valuable information about our route, and one of them gave me a map. Came on to Montpelier, a Mormon town, where there is a store and a number of dwelling houses, and after stopping awhile to lay in some supplies we came into Bennington, another Mormon town four miles from Montpelier, where we found a Store and a number of dwellings. Came through the town and camped about 1 mile the other side on a small creek near the Bear River. The houses here are all built of pine logs and most of them covered with dirt. We have passed farms all this afternoon. The wheat is just up, and the gardens are just starting to grow; the trees just putting out. We bought the largest and best potatoes I ever saw for 60¢ per bushel, flour $2.25, and as we go on things are getting cheaper. There is a valley which lies only 25 miles south of here, where there is a great difference in the climate, where they raise peaches and all kinds of fruit and cotton, I am told. I think it is the Casa Valley. We are now in Idaho, and it looks different here from the mountains and desert in Wyoming. They raise from 15 to 50 bushels of wheat here to the acre, but they have to irrigate. There is Mormon towns all along the Bear River. We saw five the other side. There is lots of stock here and good stock too, and it looks as though a man could do well here..

Went a-fishing down the Bear River about 3 miles; caught a few good speckled trout. Water too high to catch many fish. Saw cliffs along the river where there was thousands of swallows had their nests. Fred and George went off into the mountains and shot a deer, but they could not find him. They shot him, though, but the dogs would not follow him up. They hunted for him some time, but had to give it up. We are camped near a Steamboat Rock Hot Spring, where there is a bath house, and moat of the train have been to wash. There is a large rock of reddish color close to the bank of the river, and in the top of it is a basin, perhaps three feet across, where the water forces itself up from a hole in the bottom of the basin and sends it foaming about three feet in the air and falls back in the basin again. I was standing on the rock at its side, when it seemed to give an extra puff and sent the water up into my face. The water is just warm enough to bathe in without adding cold water. In the same rock, about 10 feet from the spring, is cracks in the rock where the water forces itself up through with a blowing as if there was a big bellows under it, and you can hear the noise the spring makes at some distance from the place. The most curious part of it is this: There is three of these cracks; two of them is hot and one is cold as ice water, and only 7 inches between the cracks. There is another boiling spring, besides the one spoken of yesterday - a soda spring near where we are camped. We have been drinking soda water all day, and find it a splendid drink, when fixed up in the following manner: Take a can of pourable lemonade, put some of its contents in a cup, turn in your soda water, which foams it, and the water from these soda springs being cold, you have a drink equal to any from a soda fountain. (I was down at the spring when there was a frost on, and the steam was rolling up like steam from an engine, and there is a sulphur smell comes out as though it was blowing directly from the Lower Regions.) The country all around here has the appearance of having been a volcano in active operation here some time. The rocks have the appearance of having been burnt some day, and there is large sink holes all around here, which looks as if the fire and lava had burnt out there sometime long ago.

It looked as though there had been foul play there. Traveled on after dinner and met a herd of 1600 cattle and a herd of ponies. Most of the cattle are from Oregon and Washington. They are paying as high as $40 per (?) for a man to drive the cattle and $60 if he finds his own ponies.

Left camp and came down into the valley. Found grasshoppers plenty in spots along the road. Camped for dinner by the roadside and bought wheat hay for the horses. Traveled on and early in the afternoon we arrived at Walla Walla, making the trip in 1ess than 3 months, as we had expected it would take us to go the journey. Camped outside the town and think we'll stop in this valley and work awhile. It is very dry in this valley this year, and they will have no more than a half a crop, but that will beat Nebraska. Wheat last year averaged from 35 to 40 bush. You can have some idea how it turns out when they thresh from 1500 to 2000 per day. This valley does not (illegible) no fellows as well as some we have seen. We are going to stop here awhile to work and then we are going to look for some place where we can find vacant land. Walla Walla is a very pretty place and has a population of 3500 to 4000. They have a R.R. here and everything is cheap, but there is no chance for a man to get land near here. The custom of the country here is that when a man goes out to work by the day or month, he has to sleep out of doors. I saw one man that had been out here 2½ years; had been running a header and threshing machine, and he said he had not slept in a bed since he had been in the country, and in the house only in winter. This is a very rich country here, but anyone would think by the looks of the land that it would not raise anything, but when you look at the crops they show that there is something about it that will grow them, and they show for themselves that this is a good farming country, though I don't like the looks of it as well as some other valleys I have seen. One thing: there is no grass here like there is in other places, and they have to make wheat hay. They have had a drought here this season, which gives the country a bad appearance. The country here is overrun with emigrants, as they nearly all make this their point of destination. We are going to some valley where they are not coming in so thick, and take us homes where we can get plenty of timber. Ft. Walla Walla is near here, and I have been talking with some of the soldiers. There is 500 Cavalry stationed here There is no timber in the valley and all the wood and lumber comes from the mountains some 25 miles from here. As we are going to stop here before continuing our journey, so I will quit writing and commence it again when we start once more, as my aim is to write things about this country here just as I see them, whether for or against. I see very well that the country here has been overrated in a great many things but still I think it is a good country, but not quite Heaven yet, for I think people will have to go somewhere else to find it when they die. But I think the people here are trying to obey the Scriptures (or at least to have others do so), which is to say, ʺRise, take up thy bed and walk,ʺ and furthermore, ʺI was a stranger and you took me in.ʺ We find they will do that very thing every chance they can get.

Left the Grande Ronde Valley and soon struck into the broken, hilly country. Soon came to the Indian Valley, passed on through rough country to Cricket Flats, when we went down a long, steep hill where we had to chain the wheels, and at the foot struck the Wallows River. Saw a man at this place with a fish trap, where he was ready for the red fish when they came up the river. Soon struck a canyon, which is the only entrance to the valley, and is eight miles through it into the valley and only room enough for the river and road to run. Came up the canyon about 2 miles and camped for the night at the side of the road on a small patch of ground. Here we found some fishermen waiting for the fish to come up, with their kits and barrels piled all around their camp. Started in the morning and went through one of the most dangerous looking places we have yet seen. On both sides the mountains rose almost perpendicular, and slanted down into the river. The road was cut around the mountains and through the rocks, only wide enough for one wagon to run, and in 8 miles there was but a few places where wagons could pass each other. And on one side ran the river - a deep swift stream far below us, and where in most places one foot out of the track would send a wagon down into the river, and in some places only from four to six inches out of the way would have been “all dayʺ with us. Came on and struck into the lower valley and all eyes were strained to see the beautiful valley of which we had heard so much1 but as we drove out on it we found the level land all gravel and no account for farming, only in a few places. Came into the Lower Valley and found it very rough and rocky. Was talking to a man at his ranch; asked him about the Upper Valley. Said he did not like it; it was so rough. Came on through the Middle Valley, which we found about the same as the land on the Lower, and camped for the night at a ranch between the Upper and Lower Valleys. Started in the morning and 800fl came into the Upper Valley; crossed the river and came to Lake City, the only town in the valley - a store, a saloon and blacksmith shop, and 3 or 4 houses. This town is one mile from the lake. We soon arrived at the lake, chartered a skiff and went over to the upper end of it. It is about 4 miles long and one wide, and in the deepest part 270 feet. The red fish come up in large numbers to lay their eggs, and for about 2 months the stream and lake is full of them. It may look like a big story, but it is nevertheless true, that there is a stream which comes in at the head of the lake where they get so thick that a man can stand on the edge and throw out barrels of them with a pitchfork. They have a large hook on the end of the pole and hook them out in the river below the lake. The red fish weigh from 4 to 6 lbs. and there is one great curiosity about them--when they are in the river, before they get to the lake, they are a bluish color, but when they have been in the lake awhile they turn red. There is three fisheries at the head of the lake, and one cooper's shop at the lower end, where they make barrels and kits. At the fisheries they had large piles of them ready for the fish, when they arrive in the lake. We were in a hurry and could not stop to wait on them, though some had been seen in the lake the day before we left. If we had stopped a few days we could have got all we could have hauled home. The lake is between the mountains, which slant off steep into the lake on all but one end, where the water flows out. We got some fine trout and a few red fish and had all we could eat for several meals, but did not bring any home. We did not like the valley, and therefore did not take any claims. The country is too high and cold to farm much, though we saw some grain and garden truck growing, but it was late and not very good. It may, I think, be a good stock country, as they say cattle will live here in the winter without feed in among the mountains, but it is too much out of the way to ever make much of a country. Several families left there this spring, on account of the cold weather. There is six or seven months that they cannot get in or out the valley, and have to come out to the Grande Ronde Valley to mill and lay in their supplies for winter. We started back and arrived in the Grande Ronde valley on the 28th, and concluded to go to work and not look anymore for work at present, and in time we will go to seek a country, though this valley suits us well if we could get land here. I will write no more at this time, and will fill up the balance at my leisure. Met Mr. Cole going to the Wallows Valley to take a look at it, as we were coming back. Wintered in Grande Ronde Valley. Went through haying and harvesting, which lasted until the snow commenced to fly; then built us a cabin up in the mountains, and went to making rails. Worked at that till the snow came so deep that we could do no more; then done nothing all winter. There is not much money in the valley; everything is trade; so we have to take oats and wheat for our pay. The wheat we could not sell at all, but the oats we could trade in town for store pay. We got some money but not enough to damage us much. Had a long winter, with plenty of snow and rain. In some places 10 feet of snow fell. Concluded we did not like the winter and in May, 1881 we pulled across the Blue Mountains into the Umatilla Valley, where we had to wait for the snow to get off the Cascade Mountains before we could cross. So we went to work on the R.R. which was being built up the Umatilla River. This country all along the river is very poor and sandy. There is a great many sheep kept here, but the upper portion of the valley, the Reservation of the Umatilla Indians, is a very rich and beautiful country. There is the nicest kind of bunch grass, and they have large herds of ponies, and are well fixed, and do considerable farming.

'Tis a very dangerous place here where they blast the stone; part showers down into our camp and we have to take shelter the best way we can. They are not saving at all with the powder; in one blast - what they call a pot hole - they put in 500 lbs. of powder only a few rods from where we are camped. They have a log house full of powder. I was amused the other day to see a Chinaman standing under a few weeds thrown on top of 4 sticks a little higher than his head; there he stood waiting for the blast to go, and appeared to be perfectly safe. Another Chinaman was looking up watching for the rocks to come down, when a bird came pitching down out of the air to get a chance at it, and took it to be stone, and done some tall dodging. At a camp below here we were all in the tent eating our supper, when they touched off several big blasts. The rocks came over into our camp; we could hear them striking all around the tent. Some of the men kept on eating; others jumped under the table, while a great many rushed outdoors. There was a Chinese camp a few rods from the cook tent. We heard them making an awful noise, and we found out that it was caused by a rock striking right in their bunk. One Chinaman came running around with a tin bucket over his head to protect him from the rocks. The Chinamen weighed the rock and found it weighed 100 lbs. One Chinaman the other day did not get away from the blast only a short distance before it commenced to go off. He stopped, put his coat over his head so that he could not see it, and stood still till the rocks were done falling. He was not hurt, though he ran a big risk. Mr. Jeilsen, Superintendent of the R.R., was telling us about a big blast they had on the Columbia River a few days ago. They had two tunnels under the ledge in 70 feet. Put in 200 cases of Indian Powder, 50 lbs. to the case, and touched it off by electricity. They removed at one shot 43,000 cubic yards of stone and threw it into the river. There was a Chinese camp about a mile below and they told them they had better move, but they thought they were safe and stayed. They were on a little raise of ground near the river and when so vast an amount of stone went into the river at one time it made a big wave, which rushed into their camp and swept it all away, and some of them were swept into the river. Three steamers were 2 miles below, loading with people who came up river to witness the big blast. Saw elder growing here on the banks of the river - the largest I ever saw. I measured one and found it to be 1 foot 2 inches in diameter. The river here is full of fish and we have caught lots of nice ones. In Grande Ronde Valley we lived on a small stream of clear water and we caught quite a number of salmon. This spring I weighed some of them and they weighed as follows: 74, 84, 6, 4, 34, and 11 lbs. We caught them with a pitchfork and shot some of them. They run up all the small streams in the spring and are ʺway upʺ fish. We left Mr. Weightman and family in the Grande Ronde Valley, where they settled, and Henry Norton also stopped there, and Emery Greenfield and family. Mr. Cole, our preacher, settled in the Wallowa Valley; so our party is now reduced to 2 teams - 1 horse and 2 horse team, and some loose horses and ponies. Our party now consists of the following persons: William Goldsby and wife, Fred Goldsby, Wesley Goldsby, John Goldsby, Benry Goldsby, Frank Goldsby, Marion Goldsby, George Goldsby, Frank Stevens, Willie Richardson and wife, some Nebraska folks we picked up in Grande Ronde and a young fellow by the name of Henry Overman. Fred Goldsby and myself started over the Blue Mountains the 17th of April on foot, as we wanted to work on the R.R. and could not cross over so early with teams. We crossed over 7 miles of snow from 5 to 10 feet deep and had to cross a great many streams where there was no bridges, and after getting away from the mountains, had a long distance to go over dry, sandy country where we could not get water, and arrived at the R.R. camp on the 20th, footsore and tired.

We took the trail, however, and just as we got to where we started into the Blue Mountains the fog lifted and we found a number of Indians, all of whom were men, except one exceedingly handsome girl. She was well dressed in buckskin, highly ornamented, and mounted on a proud and beautiful horse. A fine man, past middle age, was her company — father and daughter they appeared. They took no part in the trading, which indeed seemed more pretense than business. A keen eyed, powerful man would have a quart or two of pease; another as much corn ; the next a few potatoes; and over each sample would be five times the bargaining we had with the women the evening before. We took the mountain trail, which was as bad as Mr. Grant's description, and were soon overtaken by two of the Indians, who had followed to trade me a better horse and get the pistol — which I had fired in compliment to the Indian girl — to boot. They got their bargain, and I got much the worse horse. We camped that night with the most advanced section of Woodcock's company, in a deep valley in the Blue Mountains. The Cayuse chief, Sticcus, and his family are with these first teams of 1844 to cross these mountains. The family conducted worship by singing and prayer in the evening and morning. The singing sounded very sweet in the valley, but it gave me a feeling akin to shame to note that a supposed wild man was the only one who formally recognized God in his daily life. Sticcus, as the sedate old character is called by peo- ple generally, leads the way over the road that he guided those who led the trains of 1843, with such men as the Applegates, Waldos, and Nesmith, the last next to him with an axe to cut out obstructive growth an ox wagon could not pass. By taking Dr. Whitman's advice and guidance to Grand Ronde, and the guidance of Sticcus across the Blue Mountains, this way was indicated and traveled in 1843, and though rough, was much more easily traveled in 1844. All honor to Dr. Whitman and his friend and proselyte Sticcus. The service the former rendered by his advice and help to get the immigration of 1843 to Walla Walla, and the service his Indian friend aided him in, well entitle both to the remembrance of Oregonians.","journal_id":127,"lat":45.334771,"location":"Grande Ronde","long":-118.071,"name":"John Minto"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-12.741621,1.900308]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1156,"date":"10/10/1844","entry":"About 2 o'clock P. M. we emerged from the timber on the west slope of the Blue Mountains. I am this day twenty -two years of age. The sight from this mountain top is one to be remembered while life lasts. It affects me as did my first sight of the ocean, or again, my first sight of the seeming boundless treeless plains before we saw the Platte River. From this point north and south there are no bounds in sight. Looking across this grand valley westward the dark blue line of the Cascade Range of Mountains appears a forest- clad and impassable wall, out of which arise two immense white cones called, as I subsequently learned, Mount Hood and Mount Adams. Looking down the foot of the mountains we see a line of what appears brushwood, in which the glisten of water can be seen in spots. For more than two miles we descend, sometimes in a deeply worn horse trail and sometimes in sight of the dim wagon tracks made the previous year. As soon as we reach the brush and tree growth on the bank of the Umatilla River we meet Cayuse Indians. \"We are invited to stop by a sign and the words \"Swap Six\" from a young Indian who has about a peck of potatoes in a sack in front of him on horseback. He conveys to us by a sign that he wishes a shirt in exchange for his po- tatoes. We need the potatoes, as we are utterly without material for supper. After consultation we find one of our party has yet a spare shirt, and the trade is soon effected with mutual satisfaction apparently. The young man goes toward the brush, and out of the thicket came two young squaws, to whom the purchase is shown. One of them holds the garment up to the light and per-ceives that it has been worn, and she points to its being thinner at the shoulder points. The women, or girls, both begin to laugh at him, and this ends in his coming back to us for a return of his potatoes. But we think he has got his dry goods very cheap, and being hungry easily conclude as it takes two parties to make a trade it takes two to break one. The Indian suddenly rides against the one who has charge of our purchase and throws it to the ground, and begins to gather up his lasso as if to use that. One of our party, keeping his gun in one hand, got to the ground, and putting the little loosely filled sack onto the horn of his saddle vaulted into his seat and turned the muzzle of his gun towards the brave, who was swinging his lasso apparently for a throw. Four of the six of us had guns, and the brave quieted down and went away. We moved on a couple of miles and made camp, keeping a sharp lookout over our horses. This incident shows what we soon learned was a common trait of Indian trading.

His excellent seat on horseback, and the ease with which he carried his long spear, made an interesting figure. But more interesting still was General McCarver. He, like James Waters, had come expecting to meet his family, but, learning they were not on the way, he returned with us to Western Oregon, turning over to us provisions he had brought for his family under our agreement to pay him in labor in taking care of his harvest, which he had left exposed to the chances of the weather. This was a pleasant arrangement for us, the pleasure being still increased by Mr. McCarver's company, for besides being an intelligent gentleman he was at this time Speaker of the Legislature of the Provisional Government of Oregon, so that through his conversation we learned much of men and measures of the Oregon government.

We had scattered during the day's travel so that only Crockett, Clark, and myself were together when we reached the ford, where an Indian offered to guide us over for a shirt. We had none to spare, so Crockett took the stream, while Clark watched the crossing. Then Clark went over, and I watched. Crockett was out of sight among some sand hills before Clark was over ; then I followed. The care thus observed in crossing separated us two hundred and fifty to three hundred yards. As I entered the sand hills, into which both of my companions had passed, I was met on the trail by an old and small man who made the common salute of \"Swap salmon, Six\" offering his hand in great seeming friendliness, trying to make me understand. Soon another, and then several others came, each offering his hand to shake. Last came one on horseback, and, on my offering to shake hands, drew back and scowled. I remarked in English, \"Oh, I don't care if you don't wish to be friendly.\" He then, with a grin meant to be playful, signed that he would look at my gun, and took hold of the barrel near the muzzle in his right hand, with a twisting grip. I had my hand on the lock and trigger, and moved so the muzzle was at his breast. Instantly he let go as though the gun was hot. I cast my glance over my left shoulder in time to see an open hand withdrawn from being ready to close over on my horse rope. I then let out a yell which arrested Crockett and Clark, the former now much out of rifle shot. I counted and found seventeen Indians scattering just like so many wolves driven from their prey. I had just missed being robbed and stripped by the length of time it took to close my hands on my gun. It is hard to say now whether the end would have been a white man robbed or an Indian shot in the breast in the next half second, as the gun was an old flintlock and often missed fire. I was very angry and talked very bad English as long as any of the cowardly wretches were in sight. That evening we met an Indian from the mission at The Dalles who spoke English plainly.

I have to catch most of the time after taking care of my horses. When the weather gets warmer, I have so little time, it accounts for my not writing much. Brother Clayton has kindly let me have his journal to take minutes from until I can keep it up every day, which I am very thankful for. Dr. Richards has deposited a letter in a board prepared for that purpose, nailed to a long pole, with the distance marked on it of 316 miles from Winter Quarters. He was assisted by President Young and others. At 9:05 a.m. the camp proceeded onward. After traveling about two miles we crossed a small creek, which Brother Kimball named Skunk creek. About this time we discovered a stray horse coming toward us. The brethren tried to catch it, but he was so wild they could not get near him. We traveled until 11:55 and found a little better feed, then stopped for dinner, having come about six miles. The prairie is low and soft, which makes very heavy traveling. Some of the brethren shot a buffalo today. At 2 p.m. we continued our journey, and after traveling a half a mile we crossed a very bad slough.

After traveling about three-quarters of a mile we began ascending the sandy bluffs and it commenced raining again, making it very cold and disagreeable. The road was much of a zigzag one over the bluffs. We traveled about a mile, the sand being very deep and heavy pulling for the horses, and when we ascended a sand bluff we discovered the bottoms just below. We traveled on the bottoms a little way, when it was considered best to turn out our teams and not travel in the rain. It was 10:30 when we stopped. My wagon being heavy loaded, Brother Kimball told me to take the mules Brother Johnson worked ahead of his cattle and put them before my horses. We traveled about two and a half miles.

When we first ascended the bluffs our course was north for a short distance, but we then turned westward and passed over a number of sand bluffs. After traveling two and a half miles beyond the above mentioned stream we arrived at the west side of the bluffs, the last part of the road being very sandy with several very steep pitches to go down. The teams got over without any difficulty. The grass is very good west of the bluffs, and about a mile from the bluffs we passed three streams of spring water. The whole of the bottoms seem to be full of springs. We have to keep near then bluffs, the bottoms are so soft and wet. About 11:45 we stopped to feed, having traveled about six and three-quarter miles; we encamped about half a mile west of a stream of spring water, which we crossed. Brother Redding and myself went back to get some water. We went to the head of the stream and found five boiling springs, boiling up several inches. One of Brother Phineas Young's horses got mired in a swamp where he went in to feed. The brethren hauled him out with ropes.

We crossed a number of small streams which rise from springs near the bluffs. About three o'clock word came that there was a buffalo killed by the hunters about a mile from the camp and two men were sent out to dress it.

He also stated that life was as dear to the animal, according to their understanding, as it was to us. That if the horsemen hunters would go ahead and hunt out the road they would be of more utility to the camp than pursuing every band of antelope that passed the camp; that there were man among us in responsible positions who cared no more for the for the interest of the camp than the horses that they rode; that the spirit of the hunter as was now manifested would lead them to kill all the game within a thousand miles as inconsistently as the butcher would apply a knife to the throat of a bullock. President Young, after some remarks, dismissed the captains, telling them that they must lead their men by their own good example, for the men would do well if the captains would set them the proper pattern. Soon after the meeting was dismissed the bugle sounded to collect our teams. AT 8:15 a.m. we proceeded on our journey, Brigham, Herber and some others going on ahead on horseback. After traveling three and three-quarters miles a west course we arrived at a stream twenty of twenty-five feet wide and about eighteen inches deep, with a very strong current. We gave it the name of Rat Bank creek. From this stream we traveled near the bank of the river, about a northwest course. At 11:10 a.m. we stopped to feed, having traveled about six and a half miles. This afternoon has been very hot. We saw several spots of small cedar trees growing in the sandy crevices of the rocks opposite here, the head of Cedar bluffs, as named by Fremont, is three miles west of where we were encamped last night.

Captain Redding is a faithful, praiseworthy man, and a man who works for the good of the camp. As feed is not good here it was thought best to move on a few miles before breakfast and find better feed. We started out about 5:05 and crossed two small streams, traveling three and three-quarters miles and stopped to eat breakfast. Some of the teams are a quarter of a mile ahead, of the main body of the camp. H.C. Kimball and Brother Woolsey went ahead to hunt a place where the feed was good. As the neared the bluffs they discovered that the feed was not so good, Brother Kimball sent Brother Woolsey back to tell the brethren to stop, while he went on to look out the road through the bluffs. He returned just before we started. After traveling about ten miles alone, he saw a number of wolves, some of them being very large. He tried to scare them, but they would not move out of their tracks, and he had no firearms with him. Brother Kimball has rode so much ahead to look out the way for the camp he has almost broke himself down and is pretty near sick, but his ambition and the care he has for the camp keeps him up.

He judged it to be about twenty miles distant.

Between 4 and 5 o'clock this afternoon the clouds gathered very black from the west, streaks of lightning can be seen and the distant rumbling of thunder can be heard. It has the appearance of a tremendous storm. At 5 p.m. the wind blew up strong from the northwest and the storm passes northeast of us. At 5:45 we encamped in a circle within a quarter mile of the river, having come eight and a quarter miles this afternoon, which makes fifteen and a half during the day. I saw a very large rattlesnake this afternoon. Wood is very scarce. We find a few sticks along the bank of the river, which has been drifted there by high water. We have not seen any buffalo for a number of days, and very little game of any kind. Some of the brethren brought a young eagle into camp, which they took out of its nest on top of the high bluffs.

They were all well dressed and behaved themselves better than any Indians I have ever seen before. Four of their chiefs came down to the camp. Colonels Markham and Sherwood showed them around the camp. They took some provisions to those who were encamped up the river, and gave the chiefs their support at the camp.

One runs to Fort John (*Laramie) and the other came on runs by the old fort. They say the road they came on is ten miles to the spring, and the one we came on is fourteen and one-quarter miles.

The land is good and plenty of timber and the warbling of the birds make it very pleasant. At 7:35 we proceeded on our journey, along the bank of the river, which appears wider here than at Laramie. We came four and one half miles and Brother Clayton put up a guideboard, ʺ100 miles from Laramie. ʺ which we came in a week lacking two and one-quarter hours. At 11:50 we halted for noon in a grove, where the feed is very good. The road this forenoon was generally level and sandy, but there was very little grass. We have traveled nine and one-half miles this forenoon. At 2 o'clock we started again, and after traveling one mile we crossed a very crooked, muddy stream about twelve feet wide and one foot deep, came five and three-quarters miles and crossed another creek. At 5:30 we came to a halt, and we saw a number of wagons encamped about a mile ahead. After waiting about half an hour, Brother Kimball, who was ahead, returned and reported that there was no feed ahead for three miles. The company ahead is one of the Oregon camps. They are making a raft to cross here. They say the regular crossing place us twelve miles ahead. We turned off to the river about half a mile from the road near a grove, the feed being tolerably good. We encamped about 6 o'clock, having come six and three-quarters miles, and seventeen during the day. Brother Kimball reports that he and some of the brethren tried to find a fording place to cross the river, but were unable to do so. Some brethren killed three antelope today.","journal_id":133,"lat":42.847779,"location":"17mi","long":-106.145,"name":"Howard Egan"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-7.270959,-2.692476]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1315,"date":"7/4/1847","entry":"The morning was fine and pleasant, and the five brethren started back to meet the camps.

At 8:15 we started on our journey and came one and a half miles, where we crossed a deep ravine with a steep bank that was very difficult to ascend. We came one and three-quarters miles and crossed a creek about two feet miles on a bridge, which the brethren had made. One mile from this we crossed another creek about five feet wide and one and one-half feet deep. At 11:45 we halted for noon, having come seven and one-quarter miles, over a sandy, barren prairie. Here the brethren tried to find a fording place. They succeeded in riding across the river, but it was considered unsafe to cross with our wagons, as the current runs very swift. The brethren turned out this noon to dig down the banks of a deep ravine, and made it passable for our wagons in a short time. At 2:30 we again started, came about three and one-quarter miles and crossed a creek about five feet wide. At 4:30 we encamped on the bank of the river, having traveled about six miles this afternoon, and during the day eleven and one-quarter miles. Our camp is about half a mile below the camp of the brethren who went ahead. They arrived here yesterday about noon, and two of the Missouri companies arrived soon after. The brethren made a contract with them to ferry our wagons over for $1.50 each, and take their pay in flour at $2.50 per hundred. They crossed the last of them this evening. The bill amounted to $34. They received their pay mostly in flour, but some little in meal and bacon. Brother Badger traveled a wagon with them. He got a horse and 100 pounds of flour, twenty-eight pounds of bacon, and some crackers to boot. The horse and provisions were worth as much as his wagon. Since the brethren arrived here, they have killed three buffaloes, one grizzly bear, three cubs and two antelope. The buffaloes are very fat and the brethren say they are very plenty back of the hills. Brother J.Redding made H.C. Kimball a present of a large cake of tallow, and dried some beef for the benefit of the camp. Tunis Rappleyee and Artemus Johnson are missing this evening. A company was sent out in search of them. Brother Rappleyee returned about 11 o'clock at night. He said that he started to go up the mountains to get some snow, about 5 o'clock, thinking he would be back before dark, but he found the hills to be eight or ten miles off.

He gave some very good instruction and council. Brother Pratt made some remarks, followed by Brother B. Young and others. The captains of Tens were notified to meet at Brother Young's wagon. It was agreed to take the wagons over in rafts and the provisions in the cutter.

When the wheels struck the sand on the other side, the current being so strong, it rolled them one over the other, and breaking the bows, and loosening the irons, etc., to the amount of $30, belonging to Brother John Pack. We next lashed four together, abreast and dragged them over as before, with poles each side of the wagon, and then long poles to reach across endways. They all got over safe. One of the poles broke and let the upper one turn on its side, but there was no damage done. Not having poles or rope enough to lash them, we thought we would try one wagon alone. Some of the brethren thought that if some person would get in the wagon and ride on the upper side, it would prevent it from turning over. I volunteered to go across in it. Soon after we pushed off, Brother Gibbons jumped in the river and caught hold of the end of the end of the wagon. When we got out about the middle of the river, the wagon began to fill with water, and roll form one side to the other, and then turn over on the side. I got out the upper side and hung on for a short time, when it rolled over leaving me off. I saw that I was in danger of being caught in the wheels or the bows, and I swam off, but one of the wheels struck my leg and bruised it some. I struck out for the shore with my cap in one hand. The wagon rolled over a number of times and was hauled ashore. It received no damage, except the bows were broken. We then thought it the safest way to take the wagons over on a raft, notwithstanding it is very slow, and will take three or four days. The wind blows very strong from the southwest, which is very nearly down stream. We have cattle on either side to tow the raft up about one mile above, where we load the wagons.

Brother Clayton crossed the river this afternoon and went back to the last creek we crossed, about one and one-half miles, and caught sixty fish that would weigh about half a pound a piece. The new canoe was launched this afternoon, and the brethren commenced ferrying over the company of Missourians. The boat would carry a common sized wagon and its load, and it works very well considering the wood is green. There has been a small company of the brethren appointed to remain at this place until the text company of Saints comes up, and then to come on with them. They are to take charge of the boat and cross all wagons they can until the brethren arrive, at $1.50 per wagon. About dark this evening the Twelve and those who were appointed to remain, went off a little ways from the camp to council. The names of those who were to stop were read over as follows: Thomas Grover, John S. Higbee, Luke S. Johnson, Appleton M. Harmon, Edmund Ellsworth, Francis M. Pomeroy, William Empey, James Davenport and Benjamin F. Stewart. Thomas Gorver was appointed their captain. The President then referred to Eric Glines, who wanted to stay, but the President said he had no council for him to stay, but he might do so as he pleased. Some explanation followed by Glines, but the unanimous feelings of the brethren were for Glines to go on. The President preached a short sermon for the benefit of the young Elders. He represented the as eternally grasping after something ahead of them, which belonged to others, instead of seeking to bring up those who were behind them. He said the way for the young Elders is to enlarge their dominions and to get a train and bring it up to the house of the Lord with them, etc. The letter of instructions was then read and approved by the brethren. The council was then dismissed. This evening Brother Rockwood divided some of the provisions which was realized for ferrying, among some of the Tens. Brother Kimball let the Brethren have a coil of rope to use on the boat, worth about $15. He got 263 pounds of flour, 100 pounds of meat and twenty-seven pounds of soap toward the pay. There has been provisions enough received for ferrying to last this camp about twenty-three days, which is a great blessing, which we should be thankful to the Lord for.

The first six miles we traveled about a west course, over several high bluffs, where the road turns to the south and rises a high bluff about a mile long. The whole face of the country as far as the eye can extend, appears to be barren and very much broken. The descent on the south side of the bluff was crooked and uneven. At 1 o'clock we halted for noon on a spot of good grass, about a quarter of a mile from a good spring, which is the first water we have come to since we left the ferry, which is about eleven and one-quarter miles. There is no timber nearer than the bluffs, which is about two miles. The Red Buttes are nearly opposite this place in a southeast direction. After stopping about an hour it was thought best to move on to the spring. We found it to be a small stream of water rising out of the quick sand. About twelve miles from the ferry there is a lake, supposed to be supplied by the spring. We could see the water boiling out of the mud in several places. The grass on the banks of this lake is very good. After watering our teams our teams we proceeded on our journey, at 2:50 p.m., bearing in a southwest course over a rolling prairie. About eight miles from the spring there is a steep descent from a bluff, and at the foot there is a ridge of sharp-pointed rocks, running parallel with the road for nearly a quarter of a mile, leaving only a narrow space for the wagons to pass and the road is very rough. At 7:40 we encamped on a small spot, surrounded by high bluffs, having traveled ten and one-quarter miles and during the day twenty-one and one-half miles. Our camp ground this evening is the poorest we have had for some time; very little grass and no wood and bad water. The country in sandy and barren, very little vegetation growing here. There is plenty of wild sage, and several low marshes near our camp ground, where our cattle get mired. O.P. Rockwell came into camp and reported that he had a fat buffalo about two miles from the camp. A team was sent out to bring it in, which did not return for some time after dark. Myers killed two buffaloes and took the tallow and tongues, and left the meat to rot on the prairie. J. Norton and A.

The word came to Brother Kimball that there was no prospect of finding water without traveling some distance ahead. He was to go ahead and find a camp ground, and if the teams were tired they could stop and feed, and then go on again, but finding a good camp ground over the bluffs to the right, it was thought best to stop for the night. Brother Kimball not seeing the camp coming up, started back alone with any fire arms and traveled six miles after dark. The brethren made a fire ridge south of the camp, which he saw some distance off.

About twenty miles from Fort Bridger we passed another spring, came a short distance further and arrived at the bottom, where the grass was plentiful. At 1:45 we halted for noon, having come nine miles, which is in latitude 41 deg. 14 min. 21 sec.

At 7:30 we proceeded on our journey, Mr. Harris waiting for the Oregon company to come up. After traveling about six miles the road forked, one continuing a west course and the other taking a southwest course. We took the left hand road to California. The junction of the road is 297 1/2 miles from Fort John (*Laramie). About 1:40 we arrived at the Little Sandy and stopped on its east bank to feed, having traveled fourteen and a quarter miles without seeing wood or water or feed for our teams. This stream is about twenty feet wide on an average, but at the fording place it is over three rods wide and two and a half feet deep, the water being muddy and the current swift. At 5:15 we commenced fording the river, and at 5:45 all the wagons were over safe, with no other loss than two tar buckets. After traveling a short distance we were met by Mr. Bridger, the principal man of the fort which bears his name, on his way to Fort John, accompanied by two men.

We turned off the road a quarter of a mile and encamped near the sandy at 6 o'clock, having come a mile and three-quarters, and during the day fifteen and a quarter miles. We found the feed to be pretty good. Soon after we encamped the Twelve and some others went to Mr. Bridger to make some inquiries about the country. I understand that it was impossible to form a correct idea from the very imperfect and irregular way in which he gave the description. My health has been very poor for the last two days. I have been afflicted with a very severe headache, but feel a little better this evening. As I had not washed my clothes for some time, I was under the necessity of washing this evening, and did not get through until after dark. After I ate supper I went down to where Mr. Bridger encamped, and from his appearance and conversation, I should not take him to be a man of truth. In his description of Bear River Valley and the surrounding country, which was very good, he crossed himself a number of times. He said that Harris knew nothing about that part of the country. He says there is plenty of timber there; that he had made sugar for the last twenty years where Harris said there was no timber of any kind. But it was my opinion that, he spoke not knowing the place that we can depend on until we see for ourselves. Brother King is sick and there are many in the camp complaining.

At dawn, the leader rouses the camp with an inharmonious: \"Get up! Get up! Get up!\" Every one rises. The first care is for the animals. They are loosed from their pickets and allowed an hour for grazing. Meanwhile we prepare our breakfast, strike our tents, and prepare for the start. The animals are driven in again, packed and saddled. We move off in corpore. We proceed at a moderate pace, in front the leader with his carts, behind him in line long drawn out the mingled riders and pack animals. In the early days of the journey we are apt to lead the pack animals by rope; later on, we leave them free, and drive them before us. At first packing causes novices much trouble on the way. Here the towering pack leans to one side; there it topples under the animal's belly. At one time the beast stands stock still with its swaying load; at another it rushes madly off, kicking out till it is free of its burden. But pauseless, like an army over its fallen, the train moves on. With bottled-up wrath the older men, with raging and swearing the younger ones, gather up their belongings, load the beasts afresh, and trot after the column. Toward noon a rest of an hour or two is made, if a suitable camp can be found, the chief requisites being fresh water, good grass, and sufficient wood. We unload the beasts to let them graze, and prepare a mid-day meal. Then we start off again, and march on till toward sunset. We set up the tents, prepare our meal, lie around the fire, and then, wrapped in our woolen blankets, commit ourselves to our fate till the next morning. In this way twenty to twenty-five miles are covered daily. The only food the animals get is grass. For ourselves, we take with us for the first week some provisions, such as ham, ship-biscuit, tea and coffee. Afterwards, we depend on hunting.

Its course is from west to east, and it empties close by the border of the State of Missouri into the river of the same name. We were about a hundred miles above its mouth. To cross us over a canoe had been sent up the river from its mouth, but it had not as yet arrived. So we camped in the meanwhile on an elevation near the river. Some miles from us, on the same side of the river, was a village of the Kas, or Kanzas Indians; across the river, somewhat farther off, were two villages of the same tribe. Near the first village there is a trading house, a smithy, and a Methodist mission. The Kas formerly lived forty miles to the west; but in 1826, in pursuance of treaties, the United States Government assigned them the district which they now inhabit; and has set apart for them for twenty years the annual sum of $3,500.00, which is given them principally in kind. The whole tribe is said to number at present 1,500 souls. The attempt to civilize the Kas and lead them to agriculture as yet has had little success. The Government has sent them some mechanics, has established a sort of model farm, and furnishes them yearly a number of cattle and swine. But they usually burn the fencing of the farm in winter and slaughter the animals. In other respects, they live, like the rest of the Indians, from hunting; and as their country, though containing some deer, and elk, has no buffalo, they go twice a year some hundreds of miles away on a buffalo hunt, and bring the dried meat back with them. A tendency toward civilization, on the other hand, is indicated by their permanent residence in villages. While all wild Indian tribes know no other shelter than their lodges, the Kas have already built villages of permanent houses, in which they spend a great part of the year. They thus form a transition from the agricultural Indians dwelling along the border of the United States and the untamed hunting hordes of the Far West.","journal_id":123,"lat":39.116628,"location":"100 miles above mouth of Ka River (Kanzas)","long":-94.6088,"name":"F.A.

The river, of which we saw but a small part, is not broad at this point, with sparse borders of cottonwood (Populus Canadensis). The river valley is a mile or two broad on either side, and bounded by small hills (bluffs). The river is shallow, but carries so much sand that one may sink in the quicksands. The very valley is covered with pure river sand.

The voyager at sea cannot long more for land than the traveler in that region for the buffalo; for only in the land of the buffalo is there comfort and superfluity. Anxiously the days are counted till one may expect the first buffalo. Every sign is investigated by which one may gauge their vicinity. Weight is attached even to dreams. Our first enthusiasm brought ruin to the careless herd; for twelve of them were immediately shot, and of most of them the tongue only was taken. The juicy, nourishing buffalo meat we all found more palatable than the lean flesh of the antelope. The next morning we went up river only ten miles, and camped there, preparatory to crossing the South Fork.

Made quite an early start again.  \"Independence Rock\" 2 miles ahead.  Struck Sweet Water River 1 mile before we reached the rock.  This rock is another curiosity.  It is about 300 yrds. long, by 100 yrds wide and about 100 feet high.  It is composed of beautiful white granite, and was named by a party of Americans passing it on the 4th of July, who chose the top of this rock and held their celebrations.  Before leaving it they inscribed this name upon it with each of their names under that.  There are upwards of several hundred names inscribed on the top and sides of it.  All have a curiosity to climb to its top.  It is situated on the north side of Sweet Water River.  The northwest end is shaped like a dome, rather broken at the top, but it gradually slopes off to the ground which is level all around it.  We forded the river 1 mile above the rock.  Four miles farther is the \"Devil's Gate\" at the right of the road.  This is one of the greatest among the many curiosities of nature.  The river here runs through perpendicular rocks about 300 feet high in a channel from 50 to 80 feet wide.  These rocks are granite also.  Upon looking at this it would seem that it had been made expressly for that purpose by the blowing and blasting of many months; but not so, it is the great, the wondrous work of nature.  The road here passes around the point of the mountain between two cliffs of rocks and strikes the river again.  One-half mile ahead is a small creek.  The road follows up the river 26 miles.  Plenty of grass and water, fuel sage, camped in this distance.  Traveled 18 miles to-day.","journal_id":141,"lat":42.451662,"location":"","long":-107.338,"name":"Elizabeth Goltra"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-5.58937,-2.272198]},"properties":{"cartodb_id":1849,"date":"7/2/1853","entry":"Saturday the 2nd.

It can be ascended, at its north side, by clambering up the rock; holes having been cut in its face for that purpose. The second or main bench can be ascended with greater ease at an opening on the south side, where the water has washed out a crevice large enough to admit the body; so that by pushing against the sides of the crevice one can force himself upward fifteen or twenty feet, which places the adventurer on the slope of the second bench. Passing around the eastern point of the tower, the ascent may be continued up the north face. A stream of water runs along the north-eastern side, some twenty rods distant from the tower; and deep ravines are cut out by the washing of the water from the tower to the creek. Nearby stands another pile of materials, similar to that composing the tower, but neither so large nor so high. The bluffs in the vicinity appear to be of the same material.

Mudgett, the owner of one of the trains we were in company with, has been across twice before, and said the canon had been passed by some few travellers so we concluded to try our luck. So in we went creeping up and down the face of the cliff wherever we could find foothold. On the opposite side the tremendous wall was overhanging; on our side it rose abruptly from the river. Then there was a sort of sloping shelf, then rose abruptly again and in some places hanging over heads. Sometimes we had to crawl on our hands and knees, at others cling along by the dwarfed cedars-rather a job with a rifle in my hands. Several times Mudgett sat down swearing he would go no farther, but he was unarmed and dared not venture back alone, and I was bound to go through, so on we went. He was a large, heavy man and did not seem to like the idea of the splash he would make in the river below. It did look rather dubious, seething and tumbling away down below us no one could tell how far, but the worst job of all was at the end where he had to scrabble along a sharply slanting bank of loose gravel that at every step went plashing into the water. When we did get through we sat down pretty well tired out and gazed back into the horrid gap and along the perilous path we had trod, and but for the fact we had just passed we would willingly have sworn that no creature without wings could pass it. We afterwards heard that one unlucky man in attempting to make the passage alone was never heard of again. I am not sorry that I have passed, but I do not think anything on earth could induce me to pass it again. All the afternoon we travelled over high rolling prairie. This afternoon we were in the nearest point to Laramie Peak. It is covered with snow one-fourth of its height, the summit is 6,000 feet above the level of the sea and has been visible for many days. Just before camping we came to the Labonte river. On its banks were a band of Sioux Indians; they have quite a village. We camped on the opposite side from them. The grass was poor but plenty of wood and water. A Sioux chief with a small band of Indians came into camp to day at noon on a begging excursion. He produced some certificates of his being a great friend to the whites, signed by no one kn6ws whom, and introduced himself by saying with infinite complacency me \"big Captain me Big Crow\" and went on to beg for bacon or powder. Savages are the same all the world over. It does very well in novels to write of the \"noble Indians,\" but the whole root, branch and generation of them are just like all other heathens-only civil from fear. Give them one chance of mastery and they will not fail to display the treachery of their nature.

Last night just before it was quite dark, three men came to the top of the bank under which we were encamped and peered cautiously down at us. By their voices we judged them to be Indians.

Their guard saw us coming in the clear moonlight, and the whole gang of them huddled together cocking their revolvers for our reception.

This singular freak of nature can be seen between 50 and 60 miles. It is a shaft of hard sandy marl. The bluffs along here assume the most singularly interesting forms. I have seen pictures of the ruins of Luxor and Thebes; if they were swelled to 10 times this size (I mean the ruins not the pictures) would very much resemble this region. One couldeasily imagine them to be the ruins of some mighty Babylon the Great builded by the Giants before the flood, so much do the walls of perpendicular rock with their terraces dotted with dwarf pine and cedars resemble architectural remains; and as the traveller wearies his eyes in gazing, he can scarcely persuade himself that the finger of the storm, alone has traced in playful mood these walls of grace and beauty. As we approached Scott's Bluffs I could not divest myself of the idea that we were about to enter some city of the olden time, the narrow gap we passed through with its towering perpendicular walls rising between two and three hundred feet like a gateway for a race of colossal beings, but language cannot describe the wonders and beauties of this region. With a young man belonging to one of the other trains, I attempted to climb to the top of the tremendous tower, on the right of the gap, by way of the slanting ground seen on the right of the sketch, but the wall on the top ... was perpendicular. We scrabbled up to the top of the wall and found it only about 1 1/2 feet thick and crumbling, and there dwindled to the size of hand baskets were our wagons creeping round the base of the cliffs. I shall not soon forget the sensation, the slip of a few feet of crumbling wall would have sent us through the thin air almost to our wagons. The road through the pass is very rough, and we did not get camped till dark; in sight of our camp there are the corpses of two Sioux elevated on four posts about eight feet high and painted red; the bodies are enclosed in blankets of the same color.

After 6 or 7 miles travel we arrived at Soda Springs, the greatest curiosities I have seen yet on the route. The first spring is off the road to the right and is a little round caldron in the rock clear as crystal, about 3 feet in diameter, with the pure soda water boiling and bubbling with the escaping gas, and when I stooped over to fill my canteen I incautiously breathed through my nostrils and felt all that tingling sensation in the nostrils, only in a much more violent degree that is known to the lovers of soda water. The taste of these singluar waters is far more agreeable than any manufactured, unsweetened soda water that I ever tasted, so sparkling and pure are they. Near this spring is a mound of scaly rock some 40 feet high with a spring of water on the top that is constantly flowing in small waves down the sides; the stone is doubtless deposited by the waters. A Shoosone [Shoshone] Indian that went to guide me to the first spring seemed highly delighted with a specimen ring I wore and seemed to know its worth, calling it \"gold, gold.\" Almost every Indian wears some kind of brass or copper rings on their fingers. There are several other springs of the same nature a little way up the road, one large one close by the Bear river, called the steam-boat springs, as it used to emit periodically puffs of vapor like a high pressure steamboat, with a noise that, could be heard 1/2 a mile .... The Indians have stopped the pipe at the bottom of the caldron with stone so the noisy discharge is stopped, but still the pure soda water boils up, fresh from dame Nature's laboratory down in the deep, deep recesses of the mountain's foundations, where no dirty fingered druggist may mix his vile abominations. All fresh and sparkling come the waters, harmonizing with the beautiful scenery around a watering place provided by nature. How long will it be before steam will make this beautiful spot as well known as Saratoga? There is a trading post here. I went in to buy a pair of moccasins. No one was in the store but a woman. I thought she was Canadian French, but she spoke English too well for that, I thought. After a little conversation I asked, \"Where are you from?\" A deep blush dyed her brown cheek and her answer came in low tones, \"I was born here.'' She was a Shoosone or Snake Indian, the wife of the trader, an old Scotchman. No white woman could have a sweeter voice and gentler manners than this woman. She and her little girls were beautifully clean, the children two of the prettiest curly headed little brownies I ever saw, something the complexion of an Italian, and in any other country but the U.S. would be called beautiful, but here the prejudice against any other shade but that produced by French chalk is so great that no beauty of feature or clearness of complexion, if it be brown, can be termed beautiful. There are several groves of cedar near the springs, and on the mountains near the river which winds along in the valley below looking like a silver ribbon. And the snow-clad mountains on the other side the river make this one of the most beautiful places in the route. Stopped for noon near the springs. In the afternoon followed up the valley to the Junction of the old Fort Hall road, then ascended a high mountain, leaving the Bear river which here turns abruptly to the south. Then descending a long ravine, very narrow steep and stony, to the Mountain Willow Creek, crossed it and went on to the next stream where we camped about 7 o'clock. Just as we turned out, it commenced raining and threatened to keep it up for the night, so as usual in such cases we fenced in the windward side of the wagon with willow brush and are ready to take it until day.","journal_id":146,"lat":42.654998,"location":"passed soda springs and junction of fort hall road; mountain willow creek, crossed then camped","long":-111.755546,"name":"William H.

In we went; down went horses, down went the nigh wheels to the hubs, and we had to paddle round in the soft alkaline mud and water for half an hour before we could get clear. While we were fussing about getting some ducks AI had shot, a party of Diggers came up gabbling round looking at our guns and arms. They are smaller than the other tribes and very inferior in appearance. We arrived at the head of Humboldt valley this morning about 11 o'clock. The river now cuts its way through deep canons in the mountains, and we have to leave the smooth valley road and climb the mountains as we cannot cut through them. I saw a patch of flowers this afternoon in a little ravine that would have delighted the eyes of some of my lady friends. There were so many varieties and all so beautiful. The road was very rough and steep over the mountains. After descending the other side, we came to a creek of good water; at its outlet we found the best camp ground we have had on Humboldt. More Indian visitors to night, in fact we rarely camp now without some. They seem very poor, no horses, 'no lodges, but little clothing. They subsist on a little ground squirrel that they poke out of their holes by slender willow wands. They are Shoshonics. I bought a horn bow and quiver from one of them; he was clad in great splendor, i.e. in a gaudy Glengarry bonnet for which he gave a pony, a scarlet blanket coat, and leggins. Altogether he was or felt very fine. ","journal_id":146,"lat":40.626708,"location":"head of humboldt valley then continue","long":-116.454262,"name":"William H.

In the morning we crossed Raft River and its tributaries, camped at night on a little creek with tolerable feed. To day old Santa Claus passed us. We saw the old nuisance at Gravel creek with his unfortunate pony's back cut to the bone by the saddle. He was staying to rest him, as he could go no farther, but he is poking along the road again. I remember now seeing him at Fort Laramie. The boys jaw him about his \"ponee,\" but he rode slowly by neither turning his head right or left or showing that he heard them, not even when we fired a pistol to scare him. At noon we encamped near the so-called Monumental rocks. They are a cluster of rocks forming a sort of semi-circle. They rise to a great height and are of a light grey color and look like the ruins of some enormous structure. They are situated in an amphitheatre of mountains, with snow capped summits. The rocks themselves rise out of a little plain covered with velvet sod. A small stream issues from their base and glitters along down the valley. A sort of thin mist hangs in the air, giving a dreamy appearance to the whole scene; and yesterday's fever has just made me feel languid enough to be content to ... enjoy the scene without a wish to destroy the illusion by getting a nearer view. All the afternoon we travelled along the same valley among rocks of the most singular shapes, some rising to great heights like the spires of churches, others of a more tower like appearance. Encamped on a sage plain near a little creek with tolerable grass. I felt so much better this afternoon and evening that I got the boys to bring me a pail of water for a good wash in the warm sunshine, but I felt better than I was, for all I made out was to faint and Joey caught me just as I was falling.

The sink seems to be two lakes, one somewhat higher than the othter, connected by a short natural canal running through a high ridge. There is quite a strong current in the stream. We stopped awhile by the first lake on a little patch of tall grass about 15 rods long and 1 wide, I believe the only green vegetation for miles round, and while Alf was hunting camp, cooked breakfast with some dead weeds, for there was no other fuel. We passed over the dividing ridge between the lakes and stopped on the edge of the second. There was no fuel, so of course no cooking could be done, and all the feed was a little short grass every blade of which shone with crystal salt.  We started for the desert about 4 p.m., following up the edge of the sink for 7 or 8 miles over a filthy plain, hard and bare, just dry mud stinking of alkali and half-rotten half-dry carcases which almost touched each other all the way along this doleful road. The under half of each carcase rots away and the upper half dries so there they lie, a horrid bas relief on the dry mud, for I have no doubt that in winter this valley is covered with shallow water from the base of the mountains on either side of it. When we arrived at the head of the sink, we left the trail and went down to the water's edge to take in our water for the desert and eat a bite. Stirring tartaric acid into every pail of water, we watered our horses and our selves, wading out into the warm greasy feeling water up to our armpits and dipping it up from below, as the nearer you get to the shore the more the water is impregnated with the alkali. For the last 150 miles, the water had been very smooth and slippery to our taste. On account of the soda, it seemed to weaken our horses much more than ourselves, making them very thin. No doubt the large quantities of bacon devoured by us neutralized in some measure the effects of the poison, and all I wonder at is if we are not rather soapy inside.

In some 5 or 6 miles from our Camp the old  road turned off to the left leading up a Valey and leaving the  chain of Bluff. This road was taken by the troops.

The passage through is level, but has been cut into  deep ravines by the torrents which run down the sides of the  Bluffs. These immense sand bluffs must have been thrown  up by the waves of a vast Sea which once covered the whole  extent of this country— On each side of the chain the bluffs  resemble the bastions of some great Military structure but  upon a more gigantic scale. The bluffs on each are several  hundred feet high and seem to have been cut down as if with  the hand of man and the sand carried out to form a level passage  through.

The former  seems to thrive best in the sandy districts growing from  a foot to three feet in height. The latter grows generally on  the alkaline flats, or in the ashy and lighter districts. It resembles  somewhat the wild gooseberry, having similar leaves  upon its stocks it burns freely and makes a hot fire while it  lasts, but like the sage, requires to be constantly replenished.  The only bird to be seen is the raven which preys upon the  thousands of carcasses that strew the plains. The sage hen  is also found in great numbers.","journal_id":147,"lat":41.949105,"location":"","long":-109.697912,"name":"William A.
